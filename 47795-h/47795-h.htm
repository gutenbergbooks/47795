<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>


<p>At the solicitation of some of my comrades, the pages of this
book were for the most part compiled from a diary which I
kept during most of the two years I served with them, and
which was written amid the scenes it attempts to describe. To
furnish them a faithful account of the principal scenes through
which they passed during this period, including sketches of the
operations in which they were engaged, and of which our Regiment
formed a part; a record of what they saw, and did, and
suffered, such as I thought they would like to read in future
days, has been my object in presenting it in this shape. As it
was written for my comrades, to them I dedicate it; and in
giving it to the public, I have only to say that if it suits them,
it suits me. With regard to facts which have since become
history, to which I have had occasion to refer, I may have committed
some errors and inaccuracies; my book was not written
in the library of the historian, but in the tent of the soldier,
and with few exceptions without other information than
such as observation and report could supply. In speaking of
prominent officers under whom we served, I have not forgotten
that some of them are still my superior officers, and that it in
nowise comports with my duties as a soldier to assume to be
their historian or critic. But the time has come when the conduct
of those who have passed into civil life may be criticized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
by those who were their inferiors in the military service. Of
such I have endeavored to speak honestly but <em>plainly</em>, remembering
that they dealt plainly with us.</p>

<p>I am under obligations to Col. Scott, 32d Iowa, Lieut. Chas.
P. Brown, A. A. Q. M., Fort Pickering, W. B. Lakin, Esq., College
Hill, Ohio, for valuable favors and assistance. I trust that time
will afford me opportunities of paying them in a better manner
than by this public acknowledgment.</p>

<p>And now I give these pages to the public, with the single
regret that the deeds of men who have so many titles to honor
and gratitude could not have been better recorded and by a
more worthy hand.</p>

<p>When at the commencement of the war the loyal
States vied with each other in offers of men and money
to the Government, Iowa, in proportion to her population
and resources, was not behind any of her sisters.
The First Regiment of Infantry, the quota of the State
under the call for three months men, was promptly
formed, and sent to the designated rendezvous. But
the people wanted to do more than this. Companies
were formed in all parts of the State. Thousands of
names were enrolled. It was not the question who
should be permitted to stay at home, but who should
have the privilege of going. The eagerness with which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the claims to acceptance of so many different companies
were pressed upon the Governor, must have been a
source of great embarrassment to him.</p>

<p>The interval between the first and second call for
troops was to many who had tendered their services,
unsuccessfully, a period of unpleasant and unprofitable
suspense; for it was a matter of uncertainty to all,
whether the services of any more troops would be
required. And who could tell? The rebellion was so
entirely without a precedent in our history, that the
most far-seeing could not say whether it was a short-lived
insurrection that could be frightened to death by
military preparation, or a movement strong in its
organization and formidable in its proportions.</p>

<p>But this period was, nevertheless, one of preparation.
Men were settling their affairs, and preparing for the
contingency which might call them from their homes.
At length, a call was made for an additional number
of troops to serve for three years, unless sooner discharged.
This altered the plans of many who thought
to enlist merely for honor and a little adventure. The
prospect was now that they would have decidedly too
much of both. Nevertheless, the supply of men greatly
exceeded the demand. None who had enlisted with
worthy motives were disposed to shrink from the
prospect.</p>

<p>Under this call the Second Regiment was organized;
and the unsuccessful candidates still waited in hope
and doubt. Finally, in the last days of May, the companies
which were to compose the Third Regiment
received orders, to their great joy, to repair to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
designated rendezvous, and by the close of the first
week in June, they were assembled in Keokuk.</p>

<p>Though comrades now, its members were, for the
most part, strangers to each other. It belonged to no
section, but rather to the State at large. The northern,
central and southern portions were represented. In
point of material it was a mixture of such elements as
a border State would be likely to furnish. There were
among us men of almost every State in the Union, and
of almost every civilized country. Nearly all, however,
were Western men either by birth or long residence,
and were (is it boasting to say it?) tempered with that
hardy, resolute spirit which is characteristic of Western
men, especially of those who dwell on the frontier.
The greater portion were from the rural districts, and
trained to active, out-door pursuits. Those who were
from the towns were for the most part river men. If
there were among us any of "the drooping city's pale
abortions," they soon learned to imitate the rough virtues
of their comrades.</p>

<p>In point of ideas, there was as great a difference as
of birth or nationality. It is claiming nothing to say
that money had not entered into the calculations of
those who first tendered their services to their country.
The one great thought was the preservation of the
Union. But such was the constitution of our ideas,
that we saw in the accomplishment of this object ulterior
results widely different. Each loved the Union for what
it was to him. To the Irishman, it was an asylum
where he could enjoy that civil liberty, and exemption
from the oppression of an established church, which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
been denied him at home. He proposed to fight now
for the preservation of that liberty. He saw in the
destruction of the Union an invitation to the ambitious
monarchs of Europe to fetter us with such chains as
bound his own unhappy country. This was why he
had enlisted.</p>

<p>To the Englishman in our ranks, America was now
his country. It was to be the dwelling-place of his
children. It promised more than any other to promote
the peace and happiness of its people, and the progress
of civilization. It was a branch of that great Saxon
tree, which, continually spreading, already overshadowed
the earth. Should it fall into the whirlpool of Gallic
anarchy? Should it degenerate into a contemptible
Mexican civilization? God forbid. He was ready to
defend it with his blood.</p>

<p>We had among us the poetical, Heaven-ascending
German. He proposed to fight for an ideal. That
ideal was liberty. It was to him the symbol of progress,
the talisman which was to lift man from earth to
Heaven. He saw in the rebellion a reactionary movement,
a tendency from democracy to aristocracy&mdash;from
the power of the people to the one man power; a repudiation
of the doctrine on which the Republic was
founded;&mdash;nay, more, an attempt to found a Government
on a maxim of absolute injustice, the assumption
that one man has the right to own another. Could
such a movement succeed? Was progress baffled? Had
the age begun to retreat? He proposed to fight, not
for the unity of the nation alone, not alone because it
was now his country, but for that principle of liberty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
which he saw, more fully than anywhere else embodied
in her institutions,&mdash;that democratic principle which is
destined one day to be the foundation of all human
government.</p>

<p>But the great majority were native Americans, coming,
immediately or remotely, from every section of the
Union, with various ties and various ideas. They combined
all these motives and ideas, and more. To vindicate
the national honor; to avenge the insults done the
flag; to overthrow all traitors and bring them to swift
punishment; to save the nation from disintegration and
ruin;&mdash;this was why they proposed to fight. Their
country was too dear an inheritance to be easily given
up. Had the Fathers fought in vain? Had Washington,
Madison and Jefferson lived to organize anarchy
and confound the world? Had it taken the wisdom and
blood of a generation to found and build a temple which
treason could tear down in an hour? Was the reason
of the ages to be contradicted? Was justice to be overthrown?
Was Progress to stop here? Must the Lamp
of Liberty which had been lighted to guide the footsteps
of the nations go out in the gloom which was gathering
around us? Such were the questions we asked ourselves.
As far as we could do, our deeds have answered
them.</p>

<p>Thus of whatever section, of whatever country, with
whatever ideas, we had now joined hands and were
comrades,&mdash;all moving toward one grand, patriotic
holy object, the preservation of our country and of
liberty.</p>

<p>And now looking around us, we saw everywhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
matter for encouragement. Every omen seemed propitious.
Every circumstance argued success. The
North was united. There was no party now. At worst,
we could but suppose the South likewise united against
us. In that case we were twenty millions; they eight
millions. We had a navy; they had none. We could
blockade their ports, and cut off their supplies from
foreign nations. We possessed manufactures, and
means of keeping up our material. In this respect
they were almost entirely deficient. We possessed a
variety of resources which rendered our government
self-sustaining in the most adverse events. They depended
solely upon cotton, which now they would not
be able to sell. And then their servile population, we
supposed, instead of being a help, would be a great
embarrassment. Besides, were we not engaged in a
just cause? and would not, then, this great disparity
in our favor enable us speedily to overcome them?
With such strength, fortified in right, it seemed impossible
that a single reverse could come upon us. Our
enthusiasm, as yet untempered by disappointment
or disaster, was unbounded. The future seemed full
of glorious events, and we longed to be hurried into
it. We had but one desire&mdash;to be uniformed, equipped
and led on.</p>

<p>For a leader we wanted a man, who, while possessing
some knowledge of military affairs, should have none
of the exclusive spirit we understood to exist among
the officers of the regular army. To suit our tastes, he
must be at once commander and comrade. Such a
colonel we were prepared to respect&mdash;to idolize. Who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
was he to be? It was understood that Captain Herron
and Congressman Vandever were candidates. We
disliked the Captain, because he had been to a military
school, and the Congressman, because he had never
been to one; it was evident, we would be hard to suit.
But it soon became apparent that, want whom we would,
our wishes would not govern the appointment. Governor
Kirkwood desired to consult only the wishes of the
officers in the matter. There was a man, Nelson
G. Williams, of Delaware county, whose claims to the
colonelcy of one of the first regiments his friends,
through the press and otherwise, had urged with great
pertinacity. It was said that he was a military man,
and yet a private citizen, and not a politician. Many
had spoken in favor of him; no one against him. He
was the man. It was determined to call this Cincinnatus
from his obscurity. In a caucus of the commissioned
officers he received nineteen votes, and, on the
strength of this nomination, was appointed.</p>

<p>We were mustered into the service of the United
States by Lieut. Alexander Chambers, of the regular
army, since colonel of the 16th Iowa. Before this
ceremony took place, the Articles of War were read to
us, and from them we inferred that it was no easy matter
to be a good soldier, and not at all safe to be a poor
one. Those who did not wish to be sworn in after
hearing them read, were allowed to decline. A few did
so; and the farewell salutations these "deserters," as
we chose to call them, received from their late comrades
were not at all calculated to make them feel joyful or
proud. As our field officers were not yet announced,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Captain Herron, as senior officer, assumed command of
the regiment. He was in every respect a gentleman;
but his discipline, though wholesome and correct, was
such as our democratic ideas enabled us poorly to
appreciate.</p>

<p>On the 10th of June, we, for the first time, saw ourselves
as a regiment. The regiment was formed in the
proper order of the companies, and marched in column
of sections, through the principal streets of the city.
We had no arms; and every company had its own style
of uniform. Nevertheless, as we marched along, we
caught, from the admiring glances of the citizens, an
idea of our importance, and that such a sight as we
presented was not to be seen every day, and that we
were destined to play no unimportant part in the war
for the Union.</p>

<p>On the 11th of June the people of Keokuk celebrated
the obsequies of Senator Douglas. Of course the "military"
had to take part in it. The three regiments were
assembled, and following each other in their appropriate
order, marched in column of platoons, to slow time,
through the principal streets, and then through clouds
of dust, and under a melting sun, away up the Mississippi
to a point somewhere between Keokuk and Fort
Madison. Here for the first time we got sight of a
hearse, magnificently trimmed in black, into which a
number of verdants were seen to peek, doubtless in
expectation of getting a sight of Douglas. We were
allowed to break ranks which was a great relief to us,
as we expected to be compelled to stand in our places
and undergo the infliction of an oration. The whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
being over, the battalions were again formed and
marched back to their quarters to quick time. The
citizens, who rode in carriages, or walked on the green
sward, pronounced this military display a grand affair;
but the soldiers who had been compelled to keep the
dusty road, going and coming, pronounced it an intolerable
bore. Some went so far as to express the profane
wish that the great senator had never been born.</p>

<p>At this time, the First Iowa was in camp near the
city. The name of their camp was Ellsworth. Their
mode of life was a great novelty to us, and the fact that
such was soon to be ours, gave it an additional interest.
Those sentinels, marching to and fro, so stern, so mute,
lent to their little city an inhospitable air, which we
were not at all pleased to see. All within ten feet of their
beat was forbidden ground. Why could we not trespass
upon it? At least we thought there could be no harm
in allowing their own men to pass out and in when they
pleased. The sentinel could not explain this. He
wanted to see the boys have all the privileges they
wished, but he must obey his orders. Then, with a
shake of the head, he would hint that it was contrary to
orders for a sentinel to talk on his beat, and pass on.
What did all this signify? Their officers were "putting
on style," we said, and the men were learning to be soldiers
pretty easily. Well, we could not blame the boys.
It was their duty to obey their orders, at all events.</p>

<p>Then there was the gate where stood Sentinel No. 1.
Through this, all who went in or out were compelled to
pass. And there stood the officer of the guard. How
magnificently attired! If men's merits were to be judged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
by their appearance, we would have supposed him a
hero of twenty battles. That Zouave cap, with the gold
lace and bugle on it; that scarlet sash; those monstrous
epaulettes;&mdash;how they dazzled! And then the neat
fitting coat and pants. And what a full chest he had!
"He must be a long-winded fellow," said we. And
that we thought would help him if he should have any
running to do, which was among the possibilities of war.
And couldn't he swim though. Well, if such a bellows
would not float a man, what would? A regiment of such
fellows would float a bridge across the Mississippi. Perhaps
the coat had something to do with it&mdash;who knew?</p>

<p>But we forgot to salute him. What daggers he
looked at us! We asked him to let us pass in. "Where
do you belong?" "To the Third Regiment." "What
do you want here?" "To see some friends." "Sentinel,
pass them in, Sir!"</p>

<p>It was indeed a novelty to most of us. The men and
officers lived in square, white tents, slept on hay, and
cooked their rations on fires built in holes dug in the
ground. Most of the men were very communicative.
A few would hold up their heads as if to say, "We have
seen service; you are greenies." Of course some of us
must have appeared very verdant to them. We plied
all manner of questions, in reply to which they told us
prodigious stories of what they had already seen, and
suffered, for their country's sake. If we were to believe
them, they were suffering greatly now. They had been
in the service a month and a half, and the Government
had furnished them no clothing and not a cent of pay!
Besides, they were half-starved, and the rations provided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
them were not fit for a dog! And their officers
treated them shamefully, too. We began to think so;
for yonder was a captain drilling his men. They obeyed
promptly; and, yet, at every command, he called them
"devils-of-hell."</p>

<p>Their officers all dressed wondrous fine. If all officers
wore such epaulettes, such bugles and such lace,
we did not wonder that there was an advance in American
gold. And when we saw that they were all exceedingly
full-chested, like the stern lieutenant at the gate, we
concluded that the coat did have something to do with it.</p>

<p>And when we went away, it was under the impression
that those soldiers would fight, and that they could
tell a few things which we did not know. We concluded,
too, that their officers put on a good deal of style; and
indeed, we said, ours were beginning to pattern after
them. A soldier did not have many rights that a white
man was bound to respect, any way. We were very
willing, very patriotic then, but we had not learned to
be contented with what we could neither prevent nor
improve.</p>

<p>About two o'clock on the morning of June 12th, we
heard a great tumult in the streets. It was the Second
Regiment preparing to leave. They had received orders
to advance into Missouri and take possession of the
Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad which the rebels were
attempting to destroy. All seemed to be greatly elated
at the prospect before them. But amid the hurry of
preparation, there was no time to talk.</p>

<p>The following afternoon the First Regiment left for
the same destination. Their boys, like those of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Second, were jubilant in spirit. They went about the
boat which was to take them away, singing a parody
on "Dixie;" and the boat moved out amid enthusiastic
cheers of a large throng of citizens. It would be our
turn to leave next. We hoped it would be soon.</p>

<p>And now the Third Iowa were the only military occupants
of Keokuk. Our quarters were in commodious
and comfortable buildings. We were provided with
blankets, warm enough, but of a very inferior quality,
and plenty of clean hay to sleep on. For subsistence,
we were turned over to the tender mercies of contractors
whom Government paid for boarding men at the
rate of two dollars and ten cents per week. It may be
surmised that it was the chief ambition of some of these
men to board us as cheaply as possible. At least we
thought so.</p>

<p>We began to see a great and unpleasant difference
between the state of things now and a month ago.
Then the time passed like a holiday. We were preparing
to leave for the war, and the people seemed to
think they could not do too much to encourage and
assist us. They idolized us as patriots, almost as
heroes. We had hazarded all we possessed, they said,
for our country's sake. We hence belonged to them.
The stripling of seventeen by enlisting gave himself to
the public. Everybody talked of him; admired, encouraged,
praised. He was a noble lad; he had the
brave heart of a man. More likely than not, half a
dozen fair misses were ready to quarrel with each other
on his account. Indeed, the ladies seemed to be unanimous
in the opinion that "none but the brave deserve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the fair." A young man who had not joined some company,
without he had a very plain excuse, was nowhere
among them. The soldier was "all in all;" the proud
recipient of every favor, whether of money, advice,
flattery, smiles or sighs. It would be surprising if these
attentions did not lead us to form a very exalted opinion
of our deserts. So it was. The people had humored us
until when they handed us over to the Government, we
were like spoiled children. We wanted to be humored
still. At least, we looked upon ourselves as gentlemen,
and thought the contractors should treat us as such.
This they certainly did not do. It was bad enough, we
thought, to compel us to eat on greasy tin plates and to
drink our coffee out of cups of the same material; but
to serve hair and brick-dust up to us in our soup, seemed
decidedly out of place. At first we contented ourselves
with dropping hints to the waiters that a reform in this
matter would be agreeable; but seeing our hints unheeded
we threw out admonitions, which were likewise a
waste of words. Finally, two companies, D and F,
indicated their displeasure, at their boarding houses, by
turning up the tables, and pelting the waiters with beef
bones. It seemed to some of our young ideas a glorious
manifestation of the old Saxon spirit of liberty. At
least, its results were salutary. In both cases it secured
us a <i>magna charta</i> in the shape of a new boarding place
with earthen dishes and palatable food.</p>

<p>It is doubtless true that under the impression that
we were suffering useless hardships, our complaints
were at times very unreasonable. Young soldiers, like
young children, sometimes act very foolishly. And as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
a person in manhood generally sees the folly of his
early days, so we subsequently had many a hearty laugh
at these complaints about what we had learned to consider
luxuries, especially during the fasts of Kirksville
and the Tallahatchie.</p>

<p>Our duties at this time differed in some respects from
those of later days. Of course we had to retire and
rise at the tap of the drum; but we had less fatigue and
guard duty and more drill. We were required to drill
six hours a day, a very irksome duty, as some had sore
feet, and the weather was quite warm.</p>

<p>It is now a matter of ludicrous astonishment to us
that before we had been in the United States service a
week, we began to grumble about our pay. The State
owed us for the three weeks we had passed in its service.
Why did it not pay us? It was not such treatment as
we had expected to receive; but now they had got us in
their power, they would do with us as they pleased.
But why did we not think of that before? And who did
we mean by that indefinite <em>they</em>? It is a monster that
has inflicted upon us untold wrongs, but could any one
give his locality?</p>

<p>At length, on the 24th of June, we received pay for
the time we had spent in the State service. It was a
small sum, less than seven dollars to each man; but
many of us had been out of money for some time, and
it may be imagined it was highly appreciated. Indeed,
before night, some of us grew quite rich over it.</p>

<p>The same day we received our arms. Instead of
the Springfield or Enfield rifle of which we had had so
many dreams, we were disappointed in finding them a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
plain, bright musket, marked, "Springfield, 1848."
But we did not know as much about these muskets then
as we do now. There are some graves on a cotton field
near Pittsburg Landing that have a tale to tell about
them to any ordnance officer that will pass that way.</p>

<p>The following day we went into camp on the site of
the late Camp Ellsworth. We received commodious
quarters in the shape of fourteen wall tents to the company.
The business of getting into camp consumed
the entire day. We were beginners then. A strong
line of sentinels was established around us. We did
not like it. No, nor have we ever learned to like to be
thus imprisoned.</p>

<p>The name of our camp was Kirkwood. It was a beautiful
situation. The ground was a gently rolling greensward,
over which were scattered trees in pleasant
variety, and, near by, swept between his bold banks the
majestic "Father of Waters."</p>

<p>It may be presumed that for the first few days of our
camp experience, we got along poorly. But we could
adapt ourselves more readily to our new mode of life
than the members of some regiments in the field; for
we had among us many whose frontier life had taught
them the mysteries of "camping out." Of course we
cooked our food badly. But the ladies who daily visited
our camp gave us many important hints on this subject.
As yet we had no surgeon; and our officers, either
from want of knowledge, or not appreciating the importance
of the matter, paid very little attention to it. It
was a long time before we learned to cook our food so
as not seriously to impair health.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>At this time a circumstance occurred which showed
that our "Saxon spirit of Liberty" was not unconquerable.
The quartermaster had furnished us no cups,
plates, knives, forks nor spoons. We were told that
we would have to buy them with our own money. This
we were determined not to do. We declared that the
Government should furnish them. The quartermaster
we believed was swindling us, and putting the money
in his own pocket. We said all manner of hard things
about him and about our officers generally. Well, after
we had been two or three days in camp, it was noticed
that most of us were provided with the articles in question.
Where or how did we get them? The quartermaster
did not furnish them, nor did any one give them
to us; we must have bought them. Thus military
discipline and hunger are great eagle-tamers.</p>

<p>But the Third Iowa was not allowed that period of
discipline and drill with which some regiments are
favored before going into active service. Almost from
the very outset, we were destined to receive our training
in the face of the enemy. On the 28th of June it
was rumored that we were to advance into Missouri.
That evening crowds of citizens visited our camp and
paid us great respect and many kindnesses. Instead
of a dress parade, as usual, we underwent the display
of a review before Colonel Curtis of the Second Regiment,
who commanded the "North Missouri Expedition."
Before tattoo it was definitely announced that
we would leave the following morning, and orders
were issued for reveille at three o'clock.</p>

<p>Reveille sounded at the appointed hour. We pulled
down our tents, packed our baggage and camp equipage
in boxes (for as yet we had no knapsacks), and by
daylight were ready to move. But it took considerable
time to convey the baggage to the boats, and we passed
the interval in singing patriotic songs and listening to
speeches which were delivered by a number of comrades
amid the greatest applause. Brilliant was the prospect
before us. It looked like a march of victory. Price
had been defeated at Booneville, and had fled with a
few followers to the borders of Arkansas. There was
nothing before us, we thought, but to occupy a conquered
country, and while preparing for a general advance,
to wipe out the irregular parties which straggled
in his wake. A vain delusion! A single fortnight
would undeceive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>At length we formed battalion, and marched through
the city to the levee, where the two steam ferry boats,
"Gate City" and "Hamilton Belle," lashed together,
lay waiting to receive us. We went aboard, amid displays
of the greatest enthusiasm on the part of the
citizens, to which our hearts, overflowing with pride
and patriotism, and, as yet, unchilled by the realities
we were to encounter, sent up a long response. At
length the boats moved out amid a storm of cheers
from citizens on shore and soldiers on board, as loud
as a young battle, and when, by reason of the distance,
our mutual voices could no longer be heard, we saw the
vast throng waving their adieus, and as we sped down
the willing waters, we watched with a lingering look the
brick city crowning the bold hills, recede through the
driving mist till it vanished. It was like taking the
last look at homes and firesides. To many it was the
last look indeed.</p>

<p>And now, as if to dispel the sad thoughts which filled
our minds, we instinctively turned our looks southward
whither we were going.</p>

<p>The day was gloomy; but it could not destroy the
pleasant effect of the scenery through which we passed.
The banks on either side rising majestically under their
weight of forest, or gently receding in green fields, with
many a little cottage quietly stowed away in their shady
nooks; the beautiful towns with their fine residences
and shady walks, where, as we passed, the people waved
their little flags and white handkerchiefs in applause;
the islands&mdash;like visions of paradise upon the peaceful
waters&mdash;fled past us&mdash;a panorama of enchanting beauty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>Toward evening we arrived at the beautiful city of
Hannibal, and were quartered in two large railroad
freight houses, the gravel floors of which constituted our
hard beds. The work of unloading and unpacking our
baggage furnished a scene of indescribable confusion.
It was impossible for every one to find what belonged
to him; and what one lost out of his own, he generally
endeavored to make up from his neighbor's pile,&mdash;a
game in which some succeeded much better than others.
In this situation we passed the following day, which
was a beautiful one, waiting for the train to arrive
which was to take us westward over the Hannibal and
St. Joseph Railroad.</p>

<p>We formed the acquaintance of several members of
the Sixteenth Illinois, two companies of which were
stationed here. They doted largely on the good times
they were having, and how much they enjoyed the hospitality
of the good Union people of Hannibal. Toward
evening our regiment marched through the city and had
a dress parade, which was witnessed by a large crowd
of citizens.</p>

<p>The following morning, July 1st, we got on board a
long passenger train with our effects, and, at ten o'clock,
the whistle sounded and we moved on. Passing out
of the city, and all along the route, the citizens greeted
us with many demonstrations of enthusiasm. But we
already began to get tired of this. We began to do less
cheering and waving of hats, and more sober thinking
about our situation and the realities we were about to
encounter. We were moving into the enemy's country
without a knapsack, haversack, or canteen,&mdash;without a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
mule or wagon of transportation,&mdash;without a cartridge
box or a cartridge,&mdash;nothing but empty muskets with
bright bayonets. The country was on fire with treason.
The people were everywhere organizing to resist the
Federal forces. The Union people received us joyfully;
but according to their own statements, they were in a
minority, hesitating, purposeless, powerless. It is true,
that at Hannibal they had organized three companies
of home guards who had one piece of artillery. Such
was the condition of things when, almost totally unequipped,
we moved into the interior of Missouri. The
risk was enormous. It was alike a risk of safety and
of reputation. The railroad led directly through the
country where Brigadier General Thomas Harris was
organizing his rebel forces. A hundred determined men
could have thrown our train off the track and captured
all of us. It is scarcely possible to conceive of greater
stupidity than to take troops into such a country in this
condition. We were perfectly helpless. We could not
have withstood fifty armed men. The ignorance of the
enemy alone was our good fortune.</p>

<p>But we dismissed apprehensions, and occupied our
minds with contemplating the beautiful landscape on
either side of us. There was an indescribable charm
in this railroad ride. It was moving upon the enemy at
a rate we had never dreamed of. The forests were full
of wild flowers and song birds whose notes we could not
hear; the level prairie sometimes stretching away in
endless distance, sometimes bounded by long stretches
of forest that looked like infantry arrayed for battle;
the lofty hills and wide green bottoms&mdash;a dissolving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
view, ever vanishing and reappearing. We were without
rations; but the train made frequent halts at the
stations, during which we would rush to the stores and
buy whatever we wanted.</p>

<p>At dark the train arrived, when two companies under
Captain Stone were left as a garrison. Four miles beyond,
at the bridge over Grand River, Captain Sladden
was left, with his company, C.</p>

<p>A mile further, the train discharged the remaining
seven companies at the little village of Utica. It was
now nine o'clock at night. Our baggage had to be
brought from the cars, (and in those days we carried as
much baggage as a division does now), wood and water
had to be got, and no one knew where to get it; every
thing was to be done; the night was quite dark, and the
roads full of ditches. It was a scene, had it been possible
to see any thing, of exquisite confusion. No one,
unless he has been with them, can appreciate the inconvenience
a regiment of young troops experience in
camping for the night for the first time under such circumstances.
But we managed to get through it all by
midnight, and, then, lying down upon the wet ground,
without a picket posted or a cartridge at hand, we
slept.</p>

<p>The following day we established our camp near the
town on a beautiful greensward, surrounded for the
most part by young timber. We found the water in its
vicinity poor and unwholesome. It was here that our
quartermaster treated us for the first time to the luxury
of pilot bread, then known by the name of crackers, but
since vulgarly called "hard tack"&mdash;a luxury we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
seldom wanted since. At night we received four rounds
of ammunition to the man, and were admonished to be
prepared for a sudden attack. Again we had no pickets
posted. A vigorous attack by a small party of men
would have utterly disorganized us. Let us thank the
combination of accidents, which, in spite of the carelessness
of our commanding officers, saved us from such
a misfortune.</p>

<p>Before the arrival of Federal troops in this section,
the rebels had everything their own way. They had
organized bands or companies at different points, and
by threats and acts of violence had terrified the Union
people into silence. But when the troops arrived, these
bands precipitately fled, and it became the turn of the
Union people to rule and rejoice. On our arrival at
Utica two or three rebels showed the cloven foot by
endeavoring to escape by flight; but, they were captured,
and, after being confined two or three days in our
guard tent, they were released on taking the oath, to
the great astonishment and indignation of the boys, who
proposed various punishments instead, among which
hanging figured conspicuously.</p>

<p>On the trip hither it had been announced that Captain
John Scott, of Company E, had been appointed
Lieutenant Colonel, and Captain William M. Stone,
of Company B, Major. Lieut. Col. Scott accordingly
assumed command the day after our arrival at this
point.</p>

<p>The Fourth of July, 1861, was a day which we shall
long remember. It was ushered in by a false alarm
about three o'clock in the morning. Two or three shots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
were fired by the sentinels, and the long roll began to
beat at a great rate. We had never heard it before;
but we knew well enough what it meant. We jumped
out of bed quicker than if a tornado had burst upon us.
It took, of course, two or three seconds to get awake.
Where were we, and what was to pay? Suddenly the
whole thing flashed upon us. We were soldiers and in
Missouri, and last night our officer had told us to be
ready for a surprise. Imagine a soldier in this predicament!
He springs first for his gun, then for his shoes.
Where are they? Some one has got them on. It is
vain to inquire after them. There is a universal clamor
of voices, and no one hears anything except what he
says himself. A cool listener outside might distinguish
such expressions as these: "Where the devil's my
hat?" "Who's got my boots?" "They're right on
us; didn't you hear the guards fire?" "Hold up your
gun there! You'll jab somebody with your bayonet."
"I don't load till I get orders." "There! I've lost my
last cartridge." "Fall in! Fall in."</p>

<p>At length he blunders upon a pair of shoes. They
are not his; for they do not fit him at all. But he gets
one of them on, and suddenly discovers that his pants
should come on first. Off come the shoe and on the
pants. By this time his head and the tent begin to
get clear. He gets on his pants, then his shoes, seizes
his gun and falls into the ranks.</p>

<p>On this occasion our companies were promptly formed
and dressed. Then there was some shivering, some
grumbling and a good deal of standing still and waiting.
Strange, thought we, that the rebels had not charged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
upon us immediately. But perhaps there was none to
charge. At length amid hoarse grumblings and suppressed
cursings, it was announced that we had been
victimized by a false alarm. Accordingly we broke
ranks and again went to bed. What was the cause of
this alarm? Some said the sentinels had got scared and
fired at a hog; others that the commanding officer had
gotten it up to exercise the men.</p>

<p>As the morning dawned, a couple of anvils (for we
had no cannon) were fired to usher in the consecrated
day. It was decided that it should be duly celebrated.
After breakfast the battalion was formed and marched
to a grove near the village where the exercises were
appointed to take place. Here we were joined by a
goodly number of citizens. It was an impressive scene.
On the soil of our own country, and yet in an enemy's
land, citizens and soldiers mingled together&mdash;fair faces
and gray hairs by the side of glittering bayonets&mdash;to
celebrate the birthday of our beloved country, now
bleeding and almost in the struggle of death. The
Declaration of Independence was read in an impressive
manner by Lieut. Col. Scott; patriotic songs were sung
in which Lieut. Mullarky of our regiment took the lead,
and the ladies joined; an appropriate and eloquent
oration was delivered by Capt. Newcomb; martial airs
were played by the band, and a series of regular toasts
were responded to with music and cheers. We then
returned to camp.</p>

<p>After dinner it was announced that Major Stone
had invited a portion of Col. Scott's people to join him
and his in a celebration at Chillicothe. Four companies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
were allowed the privilege of going. A train of cars
conveyed them thither, and from the depot they marched
to the place of meeting near the town. The exercises
were the same as those of the forenoon, except there
was, if possible, more enthusiasm. The Declaration
was read by a citizen, Lieut. Col. Scott followed with a
speech which was characteristic of the man, generous,
honest, and outspoken. He was followed by several
citizens who spoke amid frequent and loud applause.
Mr. Woolfolk, a young member of the bar, was particularly
eloquent. The language and manner in which he
referred to the past glory and present distress of our
country was sufficient to have touched the heart of the
most remorseless traitor. And when he appealed to the
patriotism of the people of Missouri, and pointed to
the glories won by her sons under Doniphan, the applause
was beyond description. When he sat down
there was a universal outcry from the soldiers for
"Major Stone," "our Presbyterian Major." The Major
mounted the stand and held for a few minutes the attention
of the assemblage. His commanding figure, his
rapid and nervous style of speaking, and his ready wit
made a marked impression upon all. He spoke with
his usual invective and sarcasm, which was now happily
directed against Claib. Jackson, General Price, and
their unfortunate followers. Before he closed, the boys
asked his permission to have a dance, to which he
replied that his religious scruples would not allow him
to participate in anything of the kind, but he would
watch the gap while they had the fun. He closed amid
rapturous applause. We were especially delighted with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the patriotic songs sung by a glee club of citizens, most
of whom were ladies. But what pleased us almost as
well was a tangible manifestation of the hospitality of
the Union people of Chillicothe, in the shape of a substantial
table of victuals, from which no soldier was
allowed to go away hungry. We did not stay to see
whether the Major's boys had their proposed dance, nor
did we greatly care to; since the boys of Company C
had this afternoon sported their new uniforms (our's
had not yet been issued to us); and the ladies had
appeared quite exclusive in their attentions to them.
We returned to our camps, having experienced a revivification
of patriotism under circumstances which we
shall never forget.</p>

<p>The following day our long desired uniform was issued
to us. It consisted of pants and dress coat of fine and
substantial gray cloth, trimmed with blue. The pants
had the blue cord down the outer seams, and the coat
had three buttons on the sleeves instead of two, marks
which on the regulation uniform indicate the rank of a
commissioned officer. In this some of the boys were
disposed to think the State designed conferring an
especial mark of honor. In connection with the coat
and pants, we received the usual complement of drawers
and shirts, two pairs of each. Adding to this the hats
and shoes already drawn at Keokuk, we now had a
complete uniform, unsurpassed, it was said, by that of
any regiment in the service. It was emphatically a
dress parade uniform. We prized it highly, and to
preserve it, many continued to wear their old clothing
as the Colonel had directed. But the advantage of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
being clothed well and in uniform was in our case not
without disadvantages. We were of course compelled
to appear on dress parade in full uniform, and with coat
buttoned to the chin. Our coats were of wool, and
heavily padded, and hence in the hot days of summer
this was exceedingly uncomfortable. It is not surprising,
then, that, on one of our first dress parades
after wearing them, five men fainted and fell from the
ranks. It was a winter uniform, heavier than is ever
furnished by the Government, and totally unfit to wear
on the long marches we were destined to make during
the hottest days of the summer. But the chief objection
to it was its color. It was the same as that adopted by
the enemy. And as we had heard that in one or two
instances Federal regiments had committed the blunder
of firing into each other, our apprehensions on this
point were not very pleasant. This indeed proved to
be an insurmountable objection; for after the battle of
Blue Mills it was condemned, orders were issued against
wearing it, <i>and then we were compelled to pay for it</i>.
But the commissioned officers drew a suit apiece, for
which, by some "hocus pocus" unknown to privates,
they got rid of paying anything. At this time, however,
we had not the slightest apprehension that it
would be charged to us; and, as we now contrasted
our condition with some of the ragged troops we had
seen, we could not but feel a sense of gratitude toward
the State by whose generosity we supposed it furnished.</p>

<p>This feeling was in decided contrast with the feelings
we entertained toward those who managed the department<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
of subsistence. The quantity of rations which we
drew, though perhaps as much as the Regulations at
that time allowed, was totally inadequate to satisfy our
hunger. Of unsubstantials, such as salt, vinegar, soap,
and candles, we had plenty. Our supply of meat was
also more than we could consume. But of bread, the
staff of life, each man received the poor pittance of
three hard crackers a day, and of beans, the other
article of vegetable diet issued to us, each man got about
a pint in eight days. These rations were evidently
insufficient for healthy, strong men, who were drilling
forenoon and afternoon, and otherwise in constant
exercise.</p>

<p>But we found some relief in trading with citizens who
daily visited our camp. Butter, milk and vegetables
they readily exchanged with us for bacon and coffee.
And, thus, with the help of a little money, we managed
to live.</p>

<p>To our credit be it said, we had not yet begun to
practice the "vandalism," which, in subsequent days,
called forth so many General Orders. Hogs and sheep,
great and small, ran through our camps unmolested.
Gardens grew unpillaged, and fowls roosted unharmed.
Our conduct did not give the lie to our professions, and
the people had every reason to believe that in estimating
us as "vandals," seeking spoils rather than anything
else, they had been grossly deceived.</p>

<p>While we were camped at Utica, Col. Williams arrived
and assumed command. Of course all watched his conduct
with great scrutiny. He was the man who, more
than any other, held in his hand our destiny. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
proper care would give us supplies, health, discipline,
and, in every way, promote our efficiency, good appearance
and good name. His conduct in battle would
greatly influence the chances of victory and glory on
the one hand, and of defeat and disgrace on the other.
It is needless to say, that his first acts disappointed us.
His efforts to preserve good discipline were certainly
commendable; but his decisions were rash and hasty.
His temper was quick and ungovernable, and his judgment
part of the time under the control of his temper.
The least mistake of a soldier was sufficient to put him
into a violent fit of rage. Of course such manifestations
tended to create a feeling of hatred and contempt
toward him on the part of his men; and so frequently
did these occur that they soon came to despise,
at once, the man, his rank and authority. A state
of things more unfortunate to our regiment, and to
many of its individual members, could scarcely have
occurred.</p>

<p>On Sunday, July 7th, our camp was visited by
Col. Smith, of the Sixteenth Illinois, which was then
stationed in two detachments, one at Hannibal, and
one at Palmyra. It was rumored that he came to
concert measures with Col. Williams for a movement
against the enemy. But of course whatever was determined
on, was kept a secret from us; for which
reason some of us thought that the Colonel was acting
very ungenerously toward us, and betraying a great
lack of confidence in us. Ah, we had something to
learn yet.</p>

<p>The same night we were victimized by another false<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
alarm, which was got up by Colonel Williams to
exercise us in forming line of battle by night. On
this occasion line of battle was formed without much
delay, when the Colonel endeavored, but with poor
success, to put us through one or two battalion man&oelig;uvers,
and then allowed us to go to quarters.</p>

<p>We were now to learn that we had not been called
into the field to wear fine uniforms and make imposing
parades. We were to learn that soldiering has some
higher realities than guard duty, drill and pilot bread.
We were to learn that our prediction of the total defeat
of the rebel cause in Missouri had been the wildest mistake,
and, that in times of war it is folly to make any
predictions whatever. In short, we were to learn what
it was to see the enemy, to be surrounded by him, and
to be shot at by him.</p>

<p>It appears that Thomas Harris, a citizen of Hannibal,
one who had been a member of Congress from Missouri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
a West Point graduate, and a man of tact and shrewdness,
as those who knew him averred, was recruiting
and concentrating, in Monroe county, south of the Hannibal
and St. Joseph Railroad, a large force of mounted
infantry, with what designs was then unknown to the
Union authorities. It is known, however, that he gave
infinite trouble to the Federal forces in northeastern
Missouri; that he baffled all efforts to capture him,
crossed the Missouri with a large force, joined Price at
Lexington, and under him commanded a division. On
the Sunday alluded to in the last chapter, Colonel Smith
and Colonel Williams agreed upon a plan for a movement
against his accumulating forces. To this end, the
Third Iowa was to furnish three companies. That evening
Colonel Williams assembled his captains, and they
cast lots for the privilege of joining in the coveted movement.
Herron, Newcomb and Warren were the lucky
men, and their companies A, F and H were thus designated
to take part in it. Thus our first expedition was
concocted on Sunday, perhaps by accident; but who
knows that the venerable colonel of the Sixteenth did
not think it well to devote the Sabbath to so good a
work?</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the companies which were to take
part in it, were thus designated, orders for preparation
were not issued to them that evening; no, nor at reveille
in the morning. It was not till after breakfast that we
received this order, and then we were allowed but ten
minutes for preparation; and what was still more astonishing,
we were not told whether to take any rations, or
what baggage to take, and what to leave behind. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
must do in ten minutes no one could tell what, or else
leave every thing undone. We, however, undertook the
job of packing up our private effects, and getting them
in shape to leave behind. But the matter on which the
colonel had rested all night so easily, had now become
suddenly and dreadfully urgent. While we were hurrying
together our things with the utmost haste, he
appeared among us in a great rage because we were
not in ranks. We were compelled to leave our property,
some of it packed, and some of it scattered about in our
tents. It was three weeks before we saw any of it again,
and some of us lost all we had. It may be imagined
that this circumstance was calculated to exalt our opinion
of Col. Williams, and to enhance our affection for
him.</p>

<p>We got aboard a train of freight cars, and after a
short delay, moved to the east. The time consumed in
our ride was passed in singing patriotic songs, and speculating
as to our destination. All that we knew of what
was before us was, that the enemy was concentrating a
large force somewhere, that he was supposed to have
artillery, and that we were to attack him.</p>

<p>About 4 P.&nbsp;M. we arrived at Palmyra, where we
were joined by two companies of the Sixteenth and
one of the Hannibal Home Guards. The men of the
Sixteenth had the advantage over us of being fully
equipped and supplied with twenty rounds of ammunition.
So also the Home Guards, who had with them
their cannon, an iron six pounder. The chief of this
piece was a soldier of the Sixteenth, who had been a
non-commissioned officer in the British artillery service<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
in India. The manner in which he handled it in the face
of the enemy, showed that he was as familiar with a
cannon as an old hunter with his rifle. But it was unfortunate
that the only ammunition with which it was
supplied was solid shot.</p>

<p>With this force we went aboard another train, and as
soon as the cannon and some commissary stores could
be got aboard, it proceeded back to Monroe, a station
eighteen miles distant. Here we got off and formed
battalion for a night march. Just at this time a heavy
rain storm came up and raged with violence during the
fore part of the night. It would be folly to attempt to
advance fourteen miles over unknown roads in the
blackness of such a night, especially as the men of our
regiment had to carry their total supply of cartridges,
twelve rounds, in their side coat pockets, where the rain
would render them unfit for use. So Col. Smith, who
was in command, seemed to have concluded; but he
gave us no orders during the whole night, whether to go
to sleep or to keep awake and await orders to take up
the march. We however availed ourselves of shelter as
best we could in the case, in a few vacant buildings;
and notwithstanding we had not a picket watching, slept
soundly.</p>

<p>The morning dawned clear and beautiful. The prairie
birds sung sweetly and the air was full of fragrance.
But the cheer which pervaded nature illy accorded with
our feelings. Wet, hungry and unrefreshed, we arose
and set ourselves to work to prepare something to eat.
The town afforded one hotel which accommodated with
warm meals the officers and many of the men. With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the aid of this, and the scant rations we had drawn, we
managed to appease our hunger, and as far as we, the
men, were concerned, were ready to move.</p>

<p>But Colonel Smith was in a dilemma. It had been
his intention to make a night march and surprise the
enemy. In this the storm had disappointed him. And
now that the enemy must be aware of his presence, he
did not know whether it were best to advance and attack
him or not. Nor is it strange that he hesitated. His
force consisted of not more than 450 men, and their supply
of ammunition was not more than sufficient to last
them through a heavy skirmish. The lowest reports of
the citizens placed the enemy's force at 900, and all
represented that the whole country was rushing to join
him. It was said that he had three pieces of cannon.
He was encamped in a dense forest from which it would
be hard to dislodge him, and where he would have the
advantage of knowing the ground in case of attack. In
addition to this, most of his force was mounted, while
we were wholly destitute of cavalry. This would enable
him unopposed to keep a network of scouts around us,
who, from eminences in the open country, would reconnoiter,
ascertain our numbers and watch our movements
unmolested. Moreover, knowing our position at all
times, he would be able to draw us into ambuscades, or
in the timber to move rapidly and suddenly upon our
flanks and rear.</p>

<p>Colonel Smith called a council of officers, and introduced
the subject to them in that unrestrained, simple
manner for which he was so peculiar: "Well, Captain,
So-and-so, what had we better do?" This was the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
in which he asked each officer for his opinion. The
council was not unanimous; but it was decided to march
against the enemy.</p>

<p>Meanwhile several horses had been impressed and
mounted with expert and daring men. This force succeeded
in running down and bringing in several of the
enemy's scouts, who appeared, at different times, watching
our movements. Of course, it was impossible to
obtain any reliable information from them.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock, we took up the march, leaving the
train of cars behind without a guard. In the order
of column the two companies of the Sixteenth had the
advance, followed by the Third Iowa battalion, under
command of Captain Herron, to whom Williams had
given the command, allowing Lieut. Col. Scott to go
along as a spectator! The enlisted men did not, at the
time, understand this shameful trick, but wondered to
see Capt. Herron giving orders to the battalion in the
presence of Lt. Col. Scott. The cannon, followed by
the Home Guards, was in our rear. Of course so small
a column did not present a very imposing appearance;
but as we thus moved toward the enemy with measured
and united tread, we felt a glow of spirits which can not
be described. Having proceeded about four miles, we
halted and partook of refreshments to the amount of a
single hard cracker to the man, without grease, water or
salt.</p>

<p>Our road led through alternate woods and prairies,
and over one or two small, muddy streams. The day
was intensely hot, and being without canteens we suffered
greatly from thirst. The country through which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
we passed was almost entirely deserted by the inhabitants.
We did not see half a dozen male citizens during
the whole day's march. While marching through the
open country, horsemen appeared, from time to time,
on our flanks, but kept beyond the range of our guns,
and reconnoitered us apparently with great coolness.
In one instance the column halted and Fishbeem unlimbered
his gun and sent one or two shots after these
curious gentlemen, which made them disappear in a
hurry. This was, in reality, a very foolish performance;
but it demonstrated to our admiring eyes the ability
of Fishbeem to handle a cannon just as we thought it
ought to be done. From that time until the battle of
Blue Mills, we put an immense amount of confidence in
artillery, and would scarcely consider ourselves safe
away from it. In marching through the woods, Col.
Smith invariably kept a line of skirmishers deployed on
either flank. This was almost a useless precaution; for
the line, never in advance of the column, afforded no
protection against a concealed enemy in front. For all
the good this did us, the enemy might have concealed
himself ahead of us, and allowed us to march unsuspectingly
to within twenty rods of his cannon before
firing. Colonel Smith was very kind and fatherly to us;
but it is plain he was not a military man. He should
have kept at least a platoon moving ahead of us as an
advanced guard.</p>

<p>About two P.&nbsp;M. we came in sight of a party posted
in the edge of a wood. Adjutant Sessions, somewhat
excited, cried, "We have met the enemy and they are
ours, boys!" Some of the privates, equally excited,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
perhaps, failed to see the point. The rebels had a fair
field for a footrace; hence the adjutant's mistake. The
cannon galloped forward, the old driver keeping up an
unearthly screeching for joy. We were put on the double
quick. Many of the boys threw away their blankets,
and even then, before the end of the race, got quite out
of breath. But we kept our places in ranks pretty
well. Verily we were going to have a fight. No, not
quite so soon. The rebels kicked the bottom out of it
by skedaddling as fast as they could. It was probably
a small picket force.</p>

<p>About 4 P.&nbsp;M., while we were marching through a
long lane which led into a dense growth of young timber,
and while the renowned "Dutch Company" of the Sixteenth,
a company of German rifles, was deployed as
skirmishers on either flank, the head of the column was
fired into by a party of the enemy concealed immediately
in advance of us. They fired about fifty shots, and perhaps
a less number were fired in reply; for the rebels
immediately fled, leaving several horses tied to the trees
and one man mortally wounded. The Colonel at this
moment happened to be riding in the rear of the column,
and in his absence every captain seemed to make such
dispositions as he saw fit. Some companies climbed the
fence to the left, some to the right, and some continued
to advance along the road. Soon Colonel Smith rode
up, appearing greatly surprised at all that had taken
place, and pointing over to the left where no one
dreamed of there being either foe or friend, said to
Captain Newcomb, "Captain, any firing over in that
direction?" But the Colonel was by no means excited.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Indeed we never saw him excited. If ever he appreciated
the magnitude of danger, he never manifested it.
So far he was a soldier.</p>

<p>Suddenly Fishbeem galloped up with his cannon, and
fired two or three shots with it into an old barn, greatly
to our encouragement and doubtless to the huge merriment
of our flying foe. Thus ended our first rencounter
with the enemy, known in official papers as "Hager's
Woods."</p>

<p>In this little affair Captain McAllister, of the Sixteenth,
who was riding in advance on horseback, was
wounded in five places. "Kansas Jack," a soldier of
the Sixteenth, who had already distinguished himself as
a scout, was wounded in the arm, and a teamster was
slightly wounded. The injury done to the enemy,
beyond the wounding mortally of one man, is not known.
It must have been inconsiderable.</p>

<p>Well, what did we do next? We stood still in ranks
for two hours, waiting for&mdash;nobody knows what. Night
at length came. Between us and the enemy there was
said to be five miles of unbroken wood. If he could
draw us into ambuscade by daylight, it would be folly
to advance now. So Colonel Smith wisely concluded to
turn back and go into camp. We countermarched a
mile and halted for the night in a field of newly harvested
rye.</p>

<p>As soon as we had stacked arms, there was a general
rush to the wagons for blankets. Some found their
own, some appropriated the first they came to, and
some were compelled to pass the night without any at
all. A picket guard composed wholly of privates was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
posted by Adjutant Sessions around the camp, two men
in a place, so as to form a line a quarter of a mile from
it either way. This guard was simply a chain of videttes
without a commanding officer, and not relieved during
the night. The only instruction given to the men was
to fire and retreat to camp if an enemy should appear.
To their credit be it said, there was not a gun fired on
the picket line that night.</p>

<p>Day again dawned beautifully. Colonel Smith, after
consulting his officers, considered it prudent to return
to Monroe. Accordingly, at eight o'clock, the column
began to move in retreat. About ten o'clock we came
upon a small party of the enemy, at whom Fishbeem
fired a few shots, which caused them to disappear
hastily. All day the "Dutch Company" kept the
flanks, and moved abreast of the column over fences
and through thick woods in a manner that excited our
admiration. Our stock of horses received some additions
by levies on rebel citizens, and an additional number
of scouts were mounted.</p>

<p>About eleven o'clock we came in sight of Monroe,
and what was our surprise to see the railroad depot and
the train of cars we had left behind in flames! On
reaching a more commanding view, we saw a long line
of rebel cavalry drawn up to receive us. We immediately
formed line, the cannon on the left. Fishbeem
bade them good morning with a six pound ball which
struck full in their midst. They did not wait for
another salute, but broke over the hill and disappeared
in the greatest precipitation. Then additional shots
were fired, but they probably took no effect, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
enemy were already behind the hill. Colonel Smith
then gave the command to move forward. Captain
Herron asked, "Shall we advance in line, Colonel?"
To which the old Colonel replied characteristically,
"Why, no; the devils are gone."</p>

<p>We now advanced toward the town, where we arrived
about noon and took a position as much concealed as
possible, the better to watch the movements of the
enemy. The scouts reported that they found one horse
with his leg shot off where Fishbeem's shot had first
fallen among the cavalry. They now began to appear in
large numbers on our left and right. A passenger
train coming from the west got within half a league
of us, when a body of horsemen galloped rapidly
toward it. Perceiving this, and the track torn up in
front of it, it halted and escaped by beating a hasty
retreat. We now took a position in a three story brick
seminary north of the town, which it was Colonel
Smith's intention to make his point of defense. For
instead of attacking the enemy, as we had come to do,
it was evident that he was now preparing to attack us.
All the afternoon columns of cavalry continued to
debouch from the woods on the southwest whence we
had retreated, now forming long lines in front, now
separating and appearing again on all sides of us. It
required more military experience than we possessed to
divine what all this meant. Meanwhile columns of
smoke rising in the distance to the east and west, told
us that they were destroying the railroad, with the
design of preventing succor from reaching us. Two
Union men, who had escaped from their lines, confirmed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the report that they had cannon. It needed no statement
of theirs to convince us that this force was immensely
superior to our own; for before night we were
completely surrounded.</p>

<p>Well, what preparations did Colonel Smith make in
the meantime to meet them? None at all. He walked
around and smoked his pipe apparently with the greatest
unconcern at all that was going on. His appearance
was entirely calculated to inspire confidence in our
situation; but that of the enemy produced decidedly
the opposite sensation. Colonel Smith made no preparations;
but the officers of the Third Iowa took it upon
themselves to erect works for defense. Captain Newcomb
and Lieutenant Brown took the lead in the
matter; the rest followed, and soon all the men were
vigorously at work. It was commenced by tearing down
some interior fences and tightly boarding the one which
enclosed the seminary square, so as to conceal us completely
from the view of the enemy. Then, seizing all
the intrenching tools the town afforded, we worked until
dark, throwing up embankments of dirt on both sides
of this wooden wall, the enemy all the while coolly
surveying our operations. That night, we slept on our
arms behind our works.</p>

<p>Thursday, July 11. When the day dawned, parties
of the enemy were in sight. During the forenoon they
continued to appear until we were again completely
surrounded. By noon we had thrown up a tolerable
breastwork, perhaps as strong as ordinary rifle-pits.
Continuing to work leisurely upon them, we waited the
movements of the enemy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>Such was our first picture of war. However it may
appear now, it did not make us feel at all buoyant then.
We were surrounded&mdash;beleaguered. Our ammunition
would not average fifteen rounds to the man, while our
cannon had but forty rounds. The ammunition of
Captain Herron's men, from being carried in their
pockets was knocked to pieces, and much of it rendered
unfit for use. Our supply of subsistence was nearly
exhausted. We had corralled in our works a number
of cattle, which would be a great help to us; but the
rebels had shrewdly driven off all the rest. Our only
supply of water was drawn from the cistern of the
seminary which two or three days at most would
exhaust. Had the rebels attacked us vigorously, we
could have made a desperate resistance, but it must have
been a short one. It was doubtless well for us that
they did not know our situation, as it would have
emboldened them to an attack. As it was, their movements
exhibited unmistakable signs of fear.</p>

<p>About two o'clock in the afternoon, an officer stationed
on the housetop with a glass informed Colonel
Smith that the enemy was planting a cannon in the
edge of the woods about three-fourths of a mile to the
north. Another minute verified the statement. A flash
was seen, a shock was heard, and a solid shot came
whistling through the air. The first three or four shots
were from a six pounder and fell short of us. But they
commenced using a nine pounder, and their shots tore
through the air unpleasantly close to our heads. At
first they fired high and their shots struck in the middle
of the town, or on the railroad track. But their aim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
soon became more accurate. One shot struck our gun
carriage and came near dismounting the piece. Another
struck the parapet behind which Company A of the
Third Iowa lay concealed, and threw two or three
bushels of dirt over them, to the infinite merriment of
all who saw it at a pleasant distance. Most of the time
during this cannonade, we rested behind our intrenchments.
A man in the building watched the enemy's
artillery from a window, and when he would see the
flash of their gun he would cry, "down!" a command
which we obeyed by dropping into the ditches, and
hugging the earth most willingly. In Company H of
our regiment, a gun went off by accident, killing one
man as he lay in the trench. Colonel Smith walked
about the enclosure, surveying things very coolly and
giving orders. The enemy's cavalry closed in, principally
from the east, but their movements were slow and
hesitating, and nothing could induce them to come
within range of our muskets. We entertained a great
contempt for such cavalry, and felt assured that we
need not apprehend any harm from them as long as
they kept mounted. Our cannon only replied twice to
theirs, Colonel Smith deeming it prudent to save his
ammunition for a greater emergency.</p>

<p>At length a train of cars was seen approaching
slowly from the east. It gave us joy, mingled with
apprehensions; for we had heard that the enemy had
captured Palmyra, and did not know but that he might
have captured the rolling stock at that point, and was
in this way sending reinforcements against us. We
could not but observe that it came very slowly, and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
were at a loss to conjecture the cause of this. Finally,
it approached sufficiently near for us to discern a flag
upon it. Colonel Smith ordered Captain Smith who
stood in the window with a glass, to direct it upon that
flag. He did so; and when he announced, "Colonel,
it is the Stars and Stripes," there went up from every
throat a shout of unfeigned joy.</p>

<p>Fishbeem now dragged his gun into the middle of
the enclosure, and opened upon the rebels with fine
effect, stampeding them in all directions. They got
their artillery away as quick as possible, and then
began to retreat, first to the south and then to the east,
Fishbeem, all the while, visiting them with his hard
favors. Their retreat soon assumed the character of a
rout. We never saw the like in all our soldiering.
There was nothing to run from that could possibly
overtake them, and yet those men of chivalry ran&mdash;well,
old trappers said their flight looked more like a
herd of buffalo stampeding, than any thing to which
they could liken it.</p>

<p>Our reinforcements consisted of four companies of
the Sixteenth with one piece of cannon. They had been
all day coming from Palmyra, a distance of eighteen
miles, having been compelled to repair the track where
the enemy had torn it up. The engine was backing its
train, and as it approached, the boys on board became
so jubilant, that they neglected to keep a strict watch
ahead of them. There was a place where the rebels had
torn up a rail; the train ran on to it, and the first two
cars tumbled down the bank. The train was running
slow, and fortunately no one was seriously hurt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>The coming friend, the flying foe, gave to us as we
beheld them a feeling of indescribable joy. Aid had
reached us in the moment when most needed. We might
have been able to hold out without assistance; but
there would have been a limit to our endurance. He
had fired in all twenty-two shots, nine of which had
struck within our works, three of them passing through
the building; but no one was hurt. It is easy to calculate
the chances of an assault. The rebels could
not have carried our works by storm, until our ammunition
had been exhausted. This he might have done
by false attacks by night. They could not have done
it in the daytime without great loss. As it was, had
they possessed ordinary courage our situation would
have been critical. On the other hand, Colonel Smith
could have thrown his men into a square, and marched
over the prairie to Palmyra, which by the wagon road
was only fourteen miles distant, without being much
disturbed. What are men on horseback with shotguns
against infantry with bayonets? So we talked encouragingly
behind our works while the enemy was
approaching. And now, when we saw him flying from
nothing in such magnificent rout, we were more than
convinced of the correctness of our conclusions.</p>

<p>That night, as we had done the night before, we lay
on our arms in the trenches. About three o'clock in
the morning, the mounted pickets fired their pieces,
and reported an enemy approaching in force. Our little
garrison was thoroughly alarmed, and we made immediate
disposition to receive him. The force proved to
be most of the remaining portion of our regiment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
approaching from the west under Col. Williams. The
arrival of these comrades coming to our assistance gave
us an additional joy, although they were too late to
relieve us from our supposed peril. They had heard,
through rebel sources, many reports of fighting near
Monroe resulting disastrously to us, and had been all
the while they were coming most impatient to reach
us, and afford us relief. They complained loudly of
Col. Williams for tardiness and hesitancy, in bringing
them forward. Much blame has ever since been
attached to that officer for not reinforcing sooner. It
was said that he made a useless delay of several hours
at Hudson. Some even went so far as to attribute this
delay to cowardice. Others assert that the delay was
made to procure ammunition. The Colonel himself has
been heard to boast of the energy and promptness he
displayed in this operation. It is not my purpose,
nor is it pleasant for me, to discuss personal matters.
I can only say, that on this, as on most other questions,
the general verdict of the officers and men was
against him.</p>

<p>The morning after the affair at Monroe, our regiment
prepared to march. But the arrival of additional reinforcements
changed the complexion of affairs. We were
reinforced by a squadron of cavalry and a section of
light artillery under Ex-Governor Wood, of Illinois,
and by the Fourteenth Illinois Infantry, which came by
rail. The Governor had come through from Quincy
with a rush, burning the houses and confiscating the
animals of guerrilla leaders, besides making prisoners
of thirty or forty noted secessionists.</p>

<p>An account of the arrival of these reinforcements is
given by Mr. Dugan in his book entitled "History of
the Fighting Fourth Division." After detailing the
circumstances of the journey of the Fourteenth from
Monticello to Monroe, the grave "historian" goes on
to say:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>"When about two miles of town we left the cars and
formed a line of battle, and supported Gov. Wood (who
had accompanied us with five companies of independent
cavalry from Quincy, Ill.), in a most brilliant charge
upon the rebel columns, which resulted in their complete
discomfiture. When the enemy's lines were broken by
the impetuous charge of the Governor and his compatriots,
and as they were flying in the wildest disorder,
the Sixteenth sallied forth from their hastily constructed
entrenchments, and poured a most destructive volley
into the enemy's ranks, which emptied many a saddle,
and sent not a few traitors to their final account."</p>

<p>My comrades, who were present on this occasion, will
at once remark with what scrupulousness our author has
detailed this occurrence. The Governor's "brilliant"
and "impetuous" "charge" upon the "rebel columns,"
which had fled twenty hours before, reminds us strongly
of Don Quixote's charge upon the army of Alifanfaron.
The first intimation we had of the coming of the Fourteenth,
was, when seeing them march up, stack arms
in column, and cook their dinners as quietly as Sancho
Panza at the saddlebags.</p>

<p>The old Governor seemed well pleased with the situation,
and withal very affable to the boys. When we
complained of having suffered on account of rations, he
told us, with a shrewd wink, that it was good enough for
us; we had no business to take prisoners with whom to
divide our rations. Judging from his retinue of butternuts,
his preaching did not at all harmonize with his
practice.</p>

<p>The councils were now changed&mdash;why, we did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
know. Our regiment went aboard a train of cars, and
about two o'clock in the afternoon moved westward
toward our former camp at Utica. About four o'clock,
we reached Salt River Bridge, which the rebels had
burned. Here we left this train, and with much trouble
and fatigue got our baggage across the bridge and on
board another train which was waiting to receive us.</p>

<p>On this train we were crammed so closely together
that it was impossible to lie down. Jolted and jammed
by the motion of the cars, we passed the night somehow,
and most of us got some sleep. Annoyed by these
inconveniences, we little thought of the dangers of this
nocturnal ride. The removal of a single rail by a mischievous
citizen would have precipitated many of us into
eternity.</p>

<p>Daylight found us at Macon city, where the train had
halted for some reason to pass the latter part of the
night. We were exceedingly hungry, having eaten
nothing since yesterday's breakfast. Colonel Williams,
knowing the difficulties of restraining men, and especially
hungry men, in a town, posted guards and would
allow no one to leave the train. He, however, took
some of the officers with him and breakfasted at a hotel&mdash;an
act which created, and justly, great indignation. An
officer that will not share with brave men their hardships,
as they share with him the perils from which he reaps
glory, deserves universal execration.</p>

<p>About ten o'clock we reached Chariton Bridge, and
Company F was detached to guard it. An incident had
occurred here, a couple of hours previous to our arrival,
not a little exciting. A party of a dozen men of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Second Iowa had come from the west to guard this
bridge. Arriving early in the morning, they had gone
into a log house close by to get breakfast, when a party
of rebels suddenly appeared and began preparations to
set the bridge on fire. The Iowa boys sprung to their
guns and rushed upon them. The rebels fled in confusion;
but Lieutenant McKinney, the commander of the
guard, attacked their leader, a young school teacher and
law student, by the name of Marmaduke. He fell upon
his knees and begged for mercy. But the lieutenant
told him a bridge burner had no claims to mercy, and
shot him through the head with his revolver. His dead
body lay upon the railroad embankment near where
Company F encamped. We buried him decently, giving
him a soldier's grave. Subsequently some Union people
of Callao came in behalf of his friends and disinterred
the body and took it away.</p>

<p>The situation of Company F was not at all enviable.
As soon as we had got off the train with our few effects
it moved on. Since the previous morning, we had had
nothing to eat, and for several days our rations had
been scant. Our hunger was intense, a few rations
of flour and bacon had been left for us; but we had no
cooking utensils except a few mess pans which we had
procured, no one knew how. We kindled a fire, kneaded
some dough in these mess pans, wrapped it around
sticks, and baked it in the blaze. We had scarcely had
time to commence cooking dinner in this way, when half
the company were ordered on picket. This, we thought,
was seeing service. During the eight days we were
here we were on guard half the time and suffered all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
these inconveniences. Contrary to the endeavors of our
officers, none of our camp equipage was sent to us,&mdash;another
circumstance which tended to increase our affection
for Colonel Williams.</p>

<p>Having left Company F at Chariton Bridge, the
train proceeded five miles further to Brush Creek
Bridge, which the rebels had burned. Here the regiment
halted till the following night, when having repaired
the bridge, Colonel Williams left Company C to guard
it, and sent Company E back to Chariton Bridge to
reinforce Company F. He then proceeded with the
remainder of the regiment to Chillicothe, where he
arrived the following forenoon. A detail was immediately
made to go to Utica to bring hither our tents,
baggage, and camp equipage. The whole mass was
thrown together without respect of companies, and
brought to Chillicothe. A regimental camp was
established, which the officers united in naming Camp
Williams.</p>

<p>The regiment was now disposed as follows: In the
regimental camp at Chillicothe, Companies A, B, H, I
and K; at Grand River Bridge, four miles west of
Chillicothe, Companies D and G; at Brush Creek
Bridge, forty miles east of Chillicothe, Company C;
at Chariton Bridge, forty-five miles east of Chillicothe,
Companies E and F.</p>

<p>These detached companies were continually threatened
more or less seriously by the enemy. They were
expected to protect the bridges and the railroad track
in their vicinity. Reports frequently came in to them
from the surrounding country, that the rebels were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
organizing to attack them. But their instructions did
not allow them to send out scouting parties to ascertain
the truth of these reports. Indeed, the military
knowledge we had expected on the part of our Colonel,
he had as yet failed to exhibit. He did not even
recommend these detached companies to construct
stockades, nor were they provided with tools to do so,
should it become necessary. None of these companies
constructed works except Company F. We built of logs
and sawdust a small square work around an old steam
saw-mill, and named it Fort Brown after its projector,
Lieut. Brown. Company A, which was subsequently
detailed to guard Medicine Creek Bridge, built a small
work near it of earth and logs.</p>

<p>On the evening of July 20th, Companies E and F,
after having passed a week of almost constant fasting
and watching, sleeping what little they were allowed
to sleep in the open air, harassed by day by continual
reports of the enemy approaching in force, and by night
by clouds of famished mosquitoes, were, to their great
joy taken aboard a train of cars, and expected to be
conveyed immediately to Chillicothe. Imagine, then,
the surprise and rage of Company F, at being awakened
about midnight and ordered to get off at another railroad
bridge in a timbered swamp. Company C was
served in the same way. Company F relieved them at
Locust Creek; but instead of being taken through to
Chillicothe, they were left at Medicine Creek. The
following day, however, these companies were relieved,
the former by Company H, and the latter by Company
A, and joined the regiment at Chillicothe. Subsequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Company D was recalled from Grand River
Bridge; but no companies were relieved after this, till
the regiment changed camp to Brookfield.</p>

<p>The time spent in guarding these bridges was a period
of constant, and sometimes harassing watchfulness. We
were constantly on the lookout for the enemy. We had
an unusual number of reports of enormous forces advancing
against us, and night was prolific of false
alarms. For in those days when the enemy were "bushwhackers,"
and videttes did not go to sleep on post, it
was not hard for one of them, straining his eyes in the
darkness, to convert an approaching horse or cow into
a man; and, as dumb beasts do not understand the
meaning of the word <em>halt</em>, it is readily converted into
an enemy. It was easy for him to hear "the tramp
of armed feet" in the rustle of the wind among the
leaves or in the walking of a few swine. And in the
"wee sma' hours," when the mind in spite of all
its efforts to keep awake, is in a half-waking, half-sleeping
state; when imagination plays such tricks
with reason as to weave a thousand airy images, and
make us think they are real, it would require no great
effort amid these noises, for the sentinel to see in the
darkness forms of assassins moving from tree to tree, or
lines of skirmishers approaching through the gloom.
And, seeing this, of course he must fire, and the report
of his piece would alarm the neighboring sentinels, and
they, too, would see images and fire. Thus the camp
would be alarmed, and the men would be compelled to
stand in ranks until the matter could be thoroughly
investigated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>Our regimental camp at Chillicothe was situated on
the north side of the railroad, and within the limits of
the town. The ground was an excellent greensward,
and the camp was systematically laid out. Our duty
was camp guard, picket guard and drill. The camp
guard generally required the heaviest detail. A strong
line of sentinels extended around the camp, and no persons
could pass them except in squads under a non-commissioned
officer for water, without a written pass
from the regimental commander. And, under Colonel
Williams, it was a serious thing to disobey orders; and
breaking guard was a risk which very few were willing
to run. Whatever may be said against the Colonel, the
discipline we attained under him while at Chillicothe,
was highly creditable to him. It was in consequence
of this discipline that our regiment had a good name
among the citizens of Missouri, such as volunteer troops
seldom gain among strangers or enemies. Their streets
were not trodden by drunken soldiers; their property
was safe; they no longer looked upon us as outlaws
and monsters. They began to have confidence in us,
and to take a more unprejudiced view of our cause.
And who knows that our conduct did not make many
friends of enemies? But it was doubtless the confinement
to which we were thus subjected in our hot, close
tents, that increased our sick lists so greatly. The
restraint imposed upon us was excessive and unreasonable.</p>

<p>At Chillicothe our camp guard was managed according
to the regulations, and the men learned the duties
of the sentinel. But the manner in which our outpost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
duty was done was horrible. As if to invite a surprise
or a raid through our camp, Colonel Williams never had
out pickets in the daytime. Nor did he ever send out
a scouting party to ascertain the movements which were
going on around him. Did he rely on Providence
alone, or on accidental reports from citizens? Or did
he unbosom his camp to his foes and trust to their
magnanimity? In the night&mdash;did the Colonel think the
enemy so foolish as to attack him in the night in the
summer season when there was so much daylight to
operate in? Or was he afraid of wolves? In the night
before "tattoo," the officer of the day would string
around the town a short distance from camp, twenty
men, two in a place, without an officer, or even a non-commissioned
officer over them. These men were not
relieved till morning, when they would come in, according
to instructions, of their own accord. If there was
any military knowledge displayed in this arrangement,
we were never able to see it.</p>

<p>Is it surprising then, that the rebels should have
organized a company of cavalry within nine miles of
us? Colonel Williams heard of this when it was too
late, and sent a detachment of men in the night to look
after them. This detachment was provided with ammunition
at the rate of ten rounds to seven men, or 1<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>7</sub>
rounds to the man! But the foolish fellows got wind
of our coming and ran off.</p>

<p>In this connection, Colonel Williams' attempt at fortifying
deserves mention. He commenced throwing up
a small work around the Union Hotel, where he had his
headquarters, the flanks of it resting on the railroad,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
which here runs in a moderate cut. What it was
intended for we can guess: to be garrisoned by a small
force when we should leave. What it was good for, no
one but Colonel Williams could tell. Charley Kostman
constructed it; as far as his part was concerned, it was
good. It was evidently intended for about a hundred
men. Was it intended to resist artillery? Why, then,
was the parapet so weak? Was it intended to contain
artillery? Why, then, were there no embrasures? Was
it intended to protect infantry? The houses of the town
on all sides of it could be filled with sharpshooters who
would render it untenable. Was it intended for any
thing? A party of men could run up the railroad track
and get into it easily. It was in all respects a humbug;
unless it be that it enabled the Colonel to sleep more
soundly than before it was built. And there it doubtless
stands to this time&mdash;a sublime monument to the
genius of him who was chosen colonel of the Third Iowa,
because he was a <em>military</em> man.</p>

<p>If Colonel Williams wanted to put up a small work
against infantry, why did he not cut timber and make
a stockade? If he wanted to make a fort which would
resist artillery, why did he not select an eligible spot,
and make one which would answer the purpose? No:
he had a grander and sublimer object. It was to put
the Union Hotel in a state of defense. And for this
purpose he kept heavy details working, day after day,
digging the baked earth in the hot sun,&mdash;which was an
outrage, and so we regarded it.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Brigadier General Hurlbut arrived
at Quincy, Illinois, and assumed command of the forces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
on the Hannibal and St. Joseph railroad. Of this
general we knew nothing, except that we had understood
he was without military experience,&mdash;a circumstance
not calculated to give us much confidence in him,
especially when we thought of the disasters of Big
Bethel and Bull Run. On assuming command, he
issued a proclamation to the citizens of Missouri, which
was about what they would have expected from a
Federal general. He adopted General Pope's plan
of making the citizens responsible for damages done
the railroad in their vicinity. This was correct; for
hitherto citizens had been mainly instrumental in these
depredations. He also issued an order announcing the
daily routine for the troops. By this order we were
compelled to drill in the schools of the soldier, company
and battalion,&mdash;in all, seven hours a day.</p>

<p>Few of my comrades have pleasant recollections of
these long drills of Chillicothe. The heat was intense
and relaxing, and the health of the regiment extremely
bad. At one time, more than half of some of the companies
were on the sick list, and few of us were entirely
well. And yet the water we obtained from the wells
of citizens was excellent, and our camp was a model
of order and cleanliness.</p>

<p>On our battalion drills, Colonel Williams generally
commanded. He taught us to execute several movements
after the manner of Scott, and once or twice
confessed that it was hard for him to get used to Hardee.
He paid particular attention to instructing the battalion
to form lines of battle rapidly and in various ways. As
a drill-master he was rigid even to severity. It must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
be allowed, that it was one of Colonel Williams' first
objects of desire to see the regiment well drilled.</p>

<p>It was not till the 4th of August that we drew our
accoutrements. Let us look back: up to this time, we
had been in an insurrectionary district, filled with
irregular forces of the enemy. From Calloway county,
which Harris held with two or three thousand men, a
two days ride would have brought an enemy to our
camp. I can not see any excuse for this criminal carelessness.
We ought to have been supplied with accoutrements
and ammunition, or kept at home. If Colonel
Williams had cartridges, he ought to have issued a
supply to his men. If he did not have any, he ought to
have seized powder and lead from the citizens, of which
they had plenty. Singular good fortune, that we were
not all captured! Were the gods propitious, or were
our enemies too chivalrous to assail us, defenseless as
we were?</p>

<p>Thus, with hard crackers and hard discipline; with
constant drills and heavy fatigues; with full guard
houses and frequent courts martial; in heat, dust, sickness
and discomfort, we passed an irksome month at
Chillicothe.</p>

<p>On the 7th of August we packed our baggage, struck
tents at the tap of the drum, got aboard a train of cars
and proceeded to Brookfield, the midway station between
Hannibal and St. Joseph. We passed the first
night without anything to eat, which naturally gave us
pleasant feelings towards certain officers who looked out
for their own comfort by supping at the hotel. The
following day we established our regimental camp on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
beautiful hill on the prairie, about a half mile east of
the town and near the railroad track. We were compelled
to dig wells to procure water. Our duties were
much the same as at Chillicothe, except that we did no
nocturnal picketing, a squadron of the Second Illinois
Cavalry, and Colonel Morgan's regiment of Missouri
Cavalry, which was organizing at this place, doing this
duty in our stead.</p>

<p>The only incident worthy of note during our stay at
Brookfield was, that the feeling against Colonel Williams
was on one occasion so aggravated by his conduct
and that of Surgeon Edwards, that it broke out in an
act of open mutiny. It was quieted, however, without
any serious consequences. Let us draw the veil of forgetfulness
over an occurrence so unfortunate, and, when
viewed at a distance by those unacquainted with the
circumstances, so discreditable to our regiment.</p>

<p>It could not be expected that an enemy as active as
the one we were attempting to suppress would allow us
nothing to do. While we were busily engaged disciplining,
he was energetically organizing. Price had been
defeated at Booneville, and driven almost out of the
State; but the secessionists seemed everywhere to have
confidence in him. Some of them had followed him in
New Mexico, and under him had one of the greatest
of leaders. He had now joined McCullough on the borders
of Arkansas, and, having greatly augmented his
forces, was undertaking no one knew how grand an
object&mdash;perhaps the conquest of Missouri. Already he
had put our army in the southwest on the defensive.
Nay, the rebel sympathizers were at this time exulting
over the reported disaster at Springfield, which was a
two fold disaster, on account of the death of the gallant
Lyon.</p>

<p>For some time, one Martin Green, a citizen of Canton,
Missouri, a brother of the well known ex-senator Green,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
acting under the authority of General Price, had been
organizing in northeast Missouri, and principally north
of the Hannibal and St. Joseph railroad, a force of
mounted men. Having been badly whipped near Athens,
Missouri, by Colonel Moore, then commanding a regiment
of home guards, but since the gallant Colonel of
the Twenty-first Missouri, he had adopted the wise policy
of shunning his enemies and employing his time in
recruiting his force and collecting supplies. He was
now said to be near Kirksville, about forty miles north
of the railroad, and General Hurlbut projected an expedition
against him. For this purpose he ordered Colonel
Williams to detach from our regiment a force of five
hundred men under Lt. Col. Scott.</p>

<p>On the 15th of August, at 1 P.&nbsp;M., orders were
issued to us to prepare immediately for a march. The
whole regiment, with the exception of the sick and convalescent,
were assembled in line, and, after detailing
from the several companies a guard of fifty men to be
left behind with the camp, the force was reduced to the
requisite number. Forty rounds of ammunition were
issued to us. This we considered an omen of something
to do; for we had heretofore carried but ten rounds. We
took three days rations in our haversacks. For want
of knapsacks we twisted or rolled our blankets, tied the
ends together and slung them over our shoulders. This
mode of carrying a blanket on light marches, where no
additional clothing is necessary, is preferable to carrying
a knapsack. Colonel Williams remained at Brookfield
in command of the camp.</p>

<p>At 5 P.&nbsp;M. we got aboard a train of cars, and dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
found us in Macon City. General Hurlbut appearing
on horseback as we got off the cars, led us to believe he
was going to command the expedition in person. In
this we were disappointed. We marched to the camp
of a detachment of the Sixteenth Illinois which was
stationed at this place, and having eaten a supper of
pilot bread and raw meat, lay down on our arms and
went to sleep. While we were sleeping, a train of cars
arrived, having on board Capt. Madison's artillery company,
with two guns and a good supply of ammunition.
This force was increased by the addition of Fishbeem
and squad with his unfailing six pounder. We were
also joined by some mounted men.</p>

<p>At midnight we were aroused and ordered to fall in.
The column was soon in motion. The night was dark,
and we stumbled along in a most disagreeable manner
over the roots of trees that crossed the road in all directions.</p>

<p>It was amusing to listen to the various conjectures as
to our destination. Most of them, however, as is seldom
the case, were in the main correct. The principal error
consisted in supposing the enemy's force greater than
it really was.</p>

<p>Colonel Scott rode or walked along, sometimes giving
his horse to a lame soldier, or perhaps taking his gun,
and talking all the while in that genial, unaffected manner
which made him so great a favorite among the men.
We were not sorry that the command of the expedition
had been given to him.</p>

<p>About sunrise we arrived at the little village of
Atlanta, where we halted in a shady grove to rest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
About 2 P.&nbsp;M. the march was resumed. The day was
warm and the roads very dusty. There was plenty of
water in the wells along the route, but all the men
could not procure it without much straggling, and we
suffered considerably from thirst. An advanced guard
commanded by Lieutenant Call preceded the column half
a mile, with a few mounted Home Guards as far in
advance of them.</p>

<p>While marching through the little village of Laplata,
an incident occurred which excited a good deal of merriment.
Lieut. Call had been informed by a citizen who
had joined us, that, at a certain house, a hotel in that
place, they kept, and frequently displayed, a rebel flag.
This the lieutenant resolved to have. He drew up his
guard before the house, and went in, followed by his two
sergeants, and demanded it. The landlord, a wretched
looking creature, avowed his secession sympathies
openly, saying, at the same time, that it was honorable
to do so, which the lieutenant could not deny. But the
lady (here was the rub&mdash;easier to capture the colors of
a regiment) said the flag had been given to her to make
into dresses for the children, that it was private property,
and we could not have it. But the lieutenant insisted
that a treasonable emblem was contraband of war, and
that he <em>must</em> have it. Still she refused; whereupon the
lieutenant pointed to the man and said, "Sergeants, take
him out." The sergeants clapped their hands on his
back, and said, "Come with us, sir!" The children
began to shriek, and the old lady cried, "You may have
the flag! You may have the flag!" The lieutenant
attached it to a lance and presented it to the battalion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
as it marched up, amid a most furious intermingling of
cheers, yells and groans. Thus did the redoubtable
advanced guard carry the enemy's town and capture a
stand of colors before the arrival of the main force.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, a joke occurred, and it is doubtful
whether it rested harder upon Lieutenant Call or the
Home Guards in advance. While the lieutenant was
marching leisurely along with his guard, a party of the
former came riding back, frantic with excitement, and
reported having seen the enemy's camp fires not far
beyond in the edge of a wood. He put his men on the
double quick, and sure enough they soon came in sight
of a smoke. It was no humbug, thought they. The
Home Guards had seen the enemy. When they had
arrived within a convenient distance, the guard was
halted, and the lieutenant rode forward at the head of
the home guards to reconnoiter. We watched them,
breathless with expectation. They rode full on to the
enemy's entire force. It consisted of two women washing!
Major Stone had just rode up, and when the
lieutenant reported his discovery, he indulged in some
remarks at his expense, which sounded more appropriate
than they would now.</p>

<p>We halted for the night about three miles north of
Laplata, near the residence of a Union man, who had an
excellent well of water, sufficient to supply the whole
force. Mounted pickets were posted on the approaches
to our position. We could only account for this unusual
precaution on the ground that the man who
now had command possessed some common sense.
Having refreshed ourselves on such a supper as our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
haversacks afforded, we spread down our blankets and
slept.</p>

<p>At seven o'clock in the morning we again moved.
All along the route, home guards continued to join us
in squads, large and small, mounted on such horses as
they had, and armed with squirrel rifles and shot guns.
These men, though patriotic and brave, were without
any experience in the business of war, and, for the most
part, without organization. On this account we were
not supposed to put great reliance on them. They
were under the obligation of an oath, and could go and
come at pleasure. But they had incentives to action to
which we were strangers. They had seen the treason
with which we were at war, and dwelt among it. It had
assailed our country only; it had not only assailed their
country, but their firesides. They had seen its monstrous
representatives, robbers, murderers, incendiaries.
They had met it on their doorsteps. It had murdered
and robbed their friends, and threatened them with like
treatment for loving their country. This, now, was their
hour of deliverance. They had come to assist strangers
against a common enemy. Their homes and possessions
appealed to them. Their dear helpless ones stretched
their arms imploringly, and seemed to say to them, "We
trust in you; save us: be men." They had come to
fight without pay, and if necessary, to board themselves.
They reported to Colonel Scott, and obeyed his orders
without murmuring or hesitation. The strong motives
which impelled them to take up arms, and the knowledge
that discipline is the strength of an army, made them
willing, if not skillful soldiers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>But another fact made them a great auxiliary to us.
They knew who among the citizens were friends, and
who enemies. They were able to give us valuable information
concerning the enemy. Besides they hailed
from all sections of the country, and on this account
made valuable scouts. But they absolutely knew not
what to do; they wanted some one to show them. Jim
Call was exactly the man. His every characteristic
admirably fitted him to command them. Cool, daring,
audacious, always taking the lead and commanding his
men to follow, Colonel Scott placed him in this position.
Whole companies reported to him, and captains obeyed
him with most undoubting confidence.</p>

<p>Our line of march was through lanes, bordered on
both sides by cultivated fields, most of the land being
planted with corn. The country was a convenient apportionment
of timber and prairie, fertile and inviting.
The inhabitants seemed well to do, and almost every
dwelling had an air of comfort about it, if not of refinement.
Indeed, in our subsequent marches in Missouri,
we saw few places where this was not the case. We
noticed few negroes; and every thing indicated that the
labor was carried on by the more willing and skillful
hands of free laborers. What could so attach this people
to slavery, a system in which they could have little
interest, as to induce them to take up arms against
their country for its sake, will be a wonder to history
as it was to us. As if out of punishment for the wrong
done its unfortunate victims, this system is a source of
infinite evil to the white man,&mdash;a noxious vapor that
spreads pestilence in society. Could there be a greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
evidence of this than the deplorable state of things in
this section of country? The operation of civil law had
ceased, justice had no sway, magistrates no authority.
Arraigned for offenses against traitors, bands of marauders
and assassins were the citizens' only tribunal.
Calling themselves soldiers, and under pretense of military
necessity, they availed themselves of every opportunity
to satiate private malice in theft and robbery,
and settle feuds of long standing, perhaps, in blood. As
a natural consequence, neighbors were in arms against
each other; friends became enemies, and brothers are
known to have joined the opposing forces and sought
each other's life. An old citizen of Kirksville had a
son in the camp of the rebel Green, and another in St.
Louis endeavoring to procure arms for a Federal regiment
then organizing, and of which he was to be the
colonel.</p>

<p>The American people are not stoics. They realize
quickly and feel keenly what is transpiring around them,
or coming upon them. The people of this section had
too much on their minds to allow them to pursue quietly
their usual avocations. The younger and the more resolute
were rushing, as feeling or choice impelled them, to
the camp of the insurgents or the standard of the country.
The rest were awaiting the course of events, or
watching, each his neighbor, with trembling and hesitation.
On the whole day's march we saw but one man
at work in the fields. He was loading hay close by the
road, and scarcely seemed to notice us as we marched
along. His appearance excited the admiration of the
boys, some of whom cried out, "bully for you!" Most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
of the people who showed themselves to us were friends.
The women and children saluted us with waving flags,
and, in some cases, the men stood armed waiting to join
us. One old negro stared at us curiously as we marched
along, and cried out, "Gorry mighty! de've got lightnin'
rods on der guns! De secesh no stan' dat!"</p>

<p>As we approached Kirksville, we heard all manner of
reports concerning the enemy. It was said that he was
not far beyond the town and would give us a fight. His
force was estimated at from 1,500 to 3,000, with three
pieces of cannon. These reports greatly hightened the
enthusiasm of the boys, and served to divert their minds
from the pain of their blistered feet and the excessive
heat and dust of the day.</p>

<p>About noon, we halted three miles from the town,
and after a short rest resumed the march. When nearly
arrived there, Colonel Scott halted the battalion, brought
it to a front, and made some well-timed remarks which
were received with great attention. He exhorted us
to patient endurance of whatever we would be called on
to suffer, and not to let any breach of discipline sully
our name. He ended by telling us that we would
doubtless soon have an opportunity of meeting the
enemy, which raised a great shout, showing the willingness
of the men to fight, and their confidence in their
commander. Major Stone followed with a few remarks,
which excited much enthusiasm. We then entered
Kirksville with flags flying, and drums beating Yankee
Doodle.</p>

<p>Here we halted and stacked arms. Green was on
Salt River, seven miles to the east. Why did we not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
push on? The reason is this: Colonel Scott's orders
were to march to Kirksville and <em>hold the place</em>. He
was also to co-operate with Colonel Moore. This officer
with his command was somewhere in the vicinity of
Athens, and Green was between him and us. Co-operation
between two forces with the enemy between them
is something unusual in war. If Colonel Scott's force
was not sufficient to attack the enemy singly, he certainly
should not have been compelled to remain here,
exposed to an attack from him. Moreover, we had no
subsistence beyond what we had brought in our haversacks,
and the rebels had stripped the country of almost
everything which could be converted into rations. It is
impossible to see the design of this movement.</p>

<p>Our first operation was to establish a guard-house,
and arrest a number of disloyal citizens. But these
traitors were dismissed on taking the oath of allegiance.
We took quarters for the night in vacant buildings belonging
to rebel citizens.</p>

<p>The following day we were visited by many citizens;
some coming to declare their friendship, some out of
curiosity, while some were doubtless spies of the enemy.
A few also were refugees from the reign of terror which
Green had inaugurated wherever he held sway. About
4 P.&nbsp;M., a report came to Colonel Scott which induced
him to send out scouting parties in different directions.
Considerable excitement ensued in camp, but nothing
transpired. That night, Lieut. Call reconnoitered the
enemy's position, and captured two of his mounted
pickets. He did this by passing through their lines,
and coming upon them from the direction of their camp.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
He answered their challenge as friends, and then riding
up closely with his party at his back, pointed his
revolver at them and told them to put down their guns,
which they did. They were armed with good looking
squirrel rifles, without bayonets, and had curious contrivances
for carrying their ammunition. The boys
visited the guard house next day, and gazed upon them
with much curiosity. They did not look like bad
men, said they had been deceived, and seemed very
penitent.</p>

<p>"What shall be done with them?" was asked.
"Shoot them," said one. "No," said another, "they
are traitors, and do not deserve a soldier's death; hang
them." Others said, "treat them as prisoners of war.
They are ignorant men and believe they are right.
Hang the leaders. They are intelligent men, and know
they are wrong." Few of the enlisted men were in
favor of the policy which was adopted,&mdash;though it was
at that time in general practice throughout Missouri,
viz.: allowing them to take the oath and go.</p>

<p>Lieut. Call found the enemy camped on Salt River
bottom, nine miles east of Kirksville. From this time
until we left Kirksville, he, at the head of scouting
parties composed of Home Guards and volunteers from
our regiment, watched the enemy constantly, and
kept Colonel Scott advised of his position and
movements.</p>

<p>We had no clothing, tents nor camp equipage; but
we accommodated ourselves to our situation somehow,
and endeavored so far to disregard the presence of the
enemy as to renew the routine of camp duty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>But in this we failed; for though we had a short
battalion drill on the forenoon of the 19th, something
transpired to induce the belief that the enemy was
advancing, and we were ordered to be ready to form
line of battle at 2 P.&nbsp;M. We swallowed a hasty dinner,
when the battalion was formed, and took position in
rear (to the west) of the town, behind a rail fence and
in the edge of a growth of young timber, behind which
stretched for several miles toward Grand River an
uninterrupted forest. If this position had the disadvantage
of the town before it, which would obstruct our
fire and afford shelter to the enemy, it had what was
perhaps an advantage, the forest behind it, which would
afford cover in case we should be compelled to retreat.
We cut brush and piled it against the fence before us,
so as effectually to conceal ourselves from view. Behind
this breastwork of leaves and boughs we waited.
Some thought they could see a column of horsemen
moving in the distance past our left. This was probably
imagination. We soon gave up all expectation of a
fight, and scattered ourselves in knots and groups under
the shade trees. The boys were amusing themselves
playing cards and telling anecdotes, when a report came
in that cast a gloom over many countenances. Corporal
Dix, of Company C, was killed. He was leading a
small scouting party, and had stopped at the house of
a citizen four miles from camp to get dinner, when he
was surprised by a small party of the enemy, and
after a short, hand to hand fight, was himself killed
and his party put to flight. They inflicted some
injury upon the rebels; but amid the conflicting statements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
no definite conclusion on this point could be
formed.</p>

<p>Corporal Dix was the first man in our regiment that
fell by the hand of the enemy. He was an excellent
comrade, and, like every good soldier, desired a name.
For this he became a scout, and almost immediately
won the admiration of the regiment. It was a misfortune
to lose so promising a soldier. There were many
commissioned officers in the service worth infinitely less
to the country than he. Thus the first sacrifice of our
regiment was one of its best and noblest men. A flag
of truce brought in his body, and the next evening at
sunset, it was buried with military honors.</p>

<p>We remained in this position the following day.
This day Captain Hawks' company of Home Guards
was organized. It amused our boys greatly to witness
this ceremony. The first sergeant commanded the
men to "fall in in two rows like the Regulars." The
Home Guards called us Regulars. This expression
afterwards became a byword in our regiment. The
same day a report was brought in by four scouts that
Lieut. Call had been cut off by the enemy with his
whole party, and that they would be captured. This
was true; but by riding a circuit of about twenty
miles they escaped, and arrived in camp about midnight.</p>

<p>The following afternoon, the camp was again thrown
into a state of excitement by the reported approach
of the enemy. The long roll was beaten, and the men
fell in under arms. The camp guard, which was a strong
one, was dismissed, and the men reported to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
respective companies. A party of men appeared in a
corn field in front of our position, and approached sufficiently
near to draw the fire of our artillery. Four
shells sufficed to drive them away. This time we
thought there would surely be a fight. The enemy had
been seen and shot at. But we soon concluded that it
was only a reconnoitering party that had disturbed us,
and relapsed into our usual quiet.</p>

<p>The following day a drizzling rain drove us into the
town for shelter. The different companies occupied
such vacant buildings as suited them best. As we were
retiring for the night, we were alarmed by the discharge
of a cannon. A party of Home Guards had some
cattle in a field, and riding in reported the enemy advancing!
Fishbeem, who had been among the first to
hear the report, had taken the responsibility of a little
artillery practice. The regiment immediately turned
out. Battalion was not formed; but the companies
were so disposed as to support the cannon which were
stationed at the cross streets on the corners of the public
square, a part being held in reserve. Captain Madison
threw several shells in the direction in which the
rebels were supposed to be advancing. It was very
foolish thus to waste ammunition, shooting at darkness
and air. Fishbeem took the more satisfactory course
of firing solid shot at the house of one Purcel, a member
of the State Legislature, and a notorious secessionist.
This operation had the effect of making a small hole
through the upper part of his mansion, and of scaring
his negroes nearly out of their wits. Scouts were sent
out and searched thoroughly, but found no enemy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Having stood till midnight in a cold, drenching rain, we
were allowed to go to our quarters.</p>

<p>The next morning a citizen brought a report that
Colonel Smith, coming to reinforce us, had been attacked
at Laplata. Several companies and a piece of
cannon were immediately got ready to reinforce him,
when another arrival contradicted this report, and
stated that General Hurlbut was coming to join us with
a large force. This proved to be true. His force consisted
of the Sixteenth Illinois, and a two pounder
cannon named "Old Abe." Our regiment was formed
in line, and as our General approached at the head of
his little column, we received him with presented arms,
the artillery at the same time firing a salute.</p>

<p>We now had hopes that the assurance Colonel Scott
had given us before marching into Kirksville would
shortly be realized. The arrival of reinforcements sufficient
to double our present force, together with the
commanding general, we looked upon as an earnest
of immediate action. We did not now stop to inquire
into the policy which had kept us a week in the presence
of a superior force of the enemy without support,
and in a destitute condition. We thought we understood
why we had not attacked the enemy: because
we had not been allowed to do so. But we did not
understand why we had received no supplies. We only
knew that when the expedition was getting ready to
start from Brookfield, Colonel Williams had said that
we were only to be gone three days. He would not
allow Quartermaster Clark to accompany it; and it was
only at the urgent request of Colonel Scott, Quartermaster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Sergeant Mix was allowed to do so. In procuring
subsistence from the country, the services of the
latter were invaluable.</p>

<p>As it was evident to us that so far the whole thing
had been badly managed by some one higher in command
than Colonel Scott; our complaints would now
have entirely ceased, had it not been for the fact that
the only things which had come to us with these reinforcements
in the way of supplies, were a few camp
utensils. Thus we were almost as destitute as before.
But we were willing to endure anything, if it would
result in victory.</p>

<p>The enlisted men now expected nothing else than to
be led against the rebels. Not one of us doubted the
result. The same evening our force was augmented
by the arrival of 150 Home Guards from the northern
border of the State. It now consisted of 400 Home
Guards, 1,200 Infantry, and four pieces of cannon.
Surely there would be no delay now. We almost felt
the exultation of victory. Let us see how we were
disappointed.</p>

<p>On the evening of General Hurlbut's arrival at Kirksville,
Lieut. Call reconnoitered Green's camp and the
approaches to it. Since our arrival at this place, he had
changed his camp to another point on Salt River bottom,
several miles south. One main road, crossing this stream
in an east and west direction, ran through it. Thus it
could be approached from front and rear. It was about
fourteen miles distant. The road approaching it from
the rear could be gained by performing a detour of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
seven or eight miles. His camp was surrounded by a
high range of hills over which he could not retreat without
the loss of his baggage and artillery. Hence, in
case of his defeat, if these two roads were held with
sufficient force, his entire <i>materiel</i> would fall into our
hands. It would require only a simultaneous attack on
these two roads to insure a speedy and decisive victory.
It was ten o'clock at night when Lieut. Call reported
the result of his reconnoissance. Colonel Scott immediately
requested General Hurlbut to allow him to march
that night and attack the enemy with his own regiment,
the mounted Missourians and Madison's artillery. The
news of this proposal spread quickly among the men.
We expected nothing else than an immediate night
march upon the enemy. The enthusiasm was unbounded.
Meanwhile the General was consulting with Col. Scott
and one or two other officers. Most of the officers of
our regiment were in favor of Col. Scott's proposition.
Whatever doubts they may have entertained of our ability
to cope with the large force Green had gathered, they
knew that nothing less than a victory would quiet the
murmurs of their men, and repay them for the needless
sufferings they had undergone. But General Hurlbut
was of a different mind. He thought that the Sixteenth
having marched sixteen miles that day, would not be in
a condition to fight after marching sixteen more. There
was much truth in this, although its importance might
not have been appreciated at that time. To Colonel
Scott's request to be allowed to march and attack the
enemy with his own force, the mounted Missourians and
Madison's artillery, he at first assented. But soon after,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
a lieutenant of the artillery came in with a groundless
report that Green had received reinforcements. This
determined the General not to run the risk of dividing
his command. Besides, he is said to have made a remark
which induced the belief that he expected aid from
General Pope. It may be that the consideration of co-operation
from Col. Moore had some influence on this
decision.</p>

<p>At all events, it is doubtful whether it would have
been safe to allow Col. Scott to move as he desired.
Night is a poor time to fight battles. A single mistake,
caused by the darkness, might bring about the heaviest
disasters. To attack an enemy in the night, unless the
attacking party is thoroughly acquainted with his situation,
is exchanging probability for chance. Our enemy
was constantly on the alert, and Colonel Scott could
not hope to surprise him. His force was camped in a
dense forest, and Colonel Scott did not know the ground.
To attack him in the rear, he would be compelled to
make a circuit of more than twenty miles before gaining
the required position. This would place Green between
him and Hurlbut at Kirksville, in a central position between
two forces which united were numerically inferior
to his own. Colonel Scott would not have attempted
to divide so small a force to attack Green at once in
front and rear. Had he moved at all, he would have
moved in but one way&mdash;directly upon the enemy, with
his force united and Hurlbut at Kirksville at his back.
This plan might have succeeded, but the risk would
have been great. But there is no doubt that if General
Hurlbut had moved in the morning with his now united<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
force, he would have compelled the enemy's retreat or
beaten him badly if he had stood.</p>

<p>When his decision not to allow Colonel Scott to move
that night was known, we were ordered to stack arms
and go to sleep. The order was sulkily given and as
sulkily obeyed. But we went to sleep in the hope that
an advance would take place next day.</p>

<p>Instead of fulfilling our expectations, next day Gen.
Hurlbut did two things, both of which were generally
considered out of place. He reviewed the troops, and
issued a proclamation to the insurgents. The review
would have been well enough, if it had not been so near
the enemy. I have no desire to comment on the proclamation
more than to say that we were at a loss to
conjecture the motives which dictated it. In it he proposed
to visit every county seat in his district with an
armed force, and there establish a committee of citizens
of both parties, and make them responsible for the preservation
of the peace in their counties. As far as we
could learn, this proposition was not less obnoxious to
the Union men than to the rebels. He concluded by
offering all armed bands of the enemy five days in which
to lay down their arms, and should they fail to do so in
that time, he would convince them of the perils of pursuing
this irregular warfare.</p>

<p>There was a printing office in town, that of the <cite>Kirksville
Democrat</cite>, a rebel sheet, whose editor had fled at
our approach. This had been taken possession of by
some members of the Third Iowa, who proposed issuing
a sheet of a different character. This was fortunate for
the General, as it afforded him means of publishing his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
proclamation. A number of copies were sent by flag
of truce to the insurgents! Green doubtless chuckled
over this, while General Hurlbut's officers and men
gnashed their teeth with rage. Those five days were
days of grace to Green. He believed General Hurlbut
would not move against him till the expiration of that
time. He employed it in completing his preparations
to get away. Meanwhile, we lay at Kirksville doing
nothing, the General probably waiting for his proclamation
to ferment.</p>

<p>The Sixteenth on their march hither, if we may believe
their own accounts, had been pretty free in the
use of property belonging to citizens. After their
arrival at Kirksville, a store had been broken open and
robbed. This called forth an order from the General,
announcing that any soldier of his command who should
break open a private house or store for the purpose
of robbery, should be "shot at once." There was
doubtless a demand for an order of this kind, but we
thought that a threat less violent would have answered
the purpose equally well.</p>

<p>On the 25th, we attended religious exercises in the
open air, and heard an army chaplain preach for the
first time since entering the service. The meeting took
place in the grove where we were then bivouacked,
behind our breastworks of brush. The sermon was
preached by the chaplain of the Sixteenth. It seemed
strange, indeed, to see men with weapons of death by
their sides, mingling their voices with the aged and
innocent, in praise to the same God. It seemed a monstrous
inconsistency. But nature is full of inconsistencies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
The God that gives joy to innocence, swallows
up cities with earthquakes.</p>

<p>As has been said, we were compelled to subsist on
the country. Sergeant Mix was careful to impress
nothing except from enemies. A bakery was taken
possession of, and men detailed to run it. This furnished
us with an insufficient supply of corn bread.
The Union people of Kirksville treated us with great
hospitality, and did all they could to promote our comfort.
But they could not furnish us with shoes in place
of those we had worn out, or with shirts in place of
those we had left behind. These things must be taken
from the enemy. Accordingly, an expedition, consisting
of Companies I and B, of our regiment, under
Major Stone, proceeded to the town of Lancaster, about
thirty miles to the north, near the Iowa State line, and
impressed from rebel citizens several wagon-loads of
boots, shoes and the like, which were distributed among
those who needed them most.</p>

<p>General Hurlbut issued his proclamation on the 26th.
On the 30th, Green began to retreat toward the south.
The same morning orders were issued to the troops at
Kirksville to be ready to move. We were ready to all
appearance to take up the march at an early hour; but,
for some reason, the departure of the column was
delayed till nearly noon. Meanwhile a rumor circulated
through the ranks that Green had gone; and, in
our mortification and rage, we could assign but one
reason for this delay; we said that the General wished
to make an outward show of courage by pursuing, but
did not wish to overtake the enemy. There seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
be an universal murmur against him. No one spoke in
defense of him or attempted to justify his measures.
Who would then have believed that under this same
man we were destined to be led to honor and glory?
We can not but suppose that he was either trammeled
by his orders, or laboring like Bonaparte at Borodino,
under some strange spell of mental lassitude. Nothing
less could have made such a failure of him who was to
be the honored General of the Fourth Division and
Sixteenth Army Corps.</p>

<p>At 11 A.&nbsp;M., the column moved; the direction was
southeast toward the late camp of Green. The most
unpleasant feature of the day's march was, that we had
nothing to eat. The day was quite hot, and the roads
dusty. The country through which we passed was not
as thickly settled as between Macon and Kirksville, and
it was consequently difficult for the men to procure
water. They straggled from the ranks in great numbers,
and ran to the wells, at every one of which would
take place a scene of indescribable greediness and confusion.
A bucket of water would be drawn, and a
hundred men would endeavor to get their canteens into
it. A score of hungry wolves wrangling over one carcass,
would scarcely be an adequate comparison. Hunger
oppressed as much as thirst, and from the wells
crowds would rush into the houses. What could be
procured by asking, was taken. But the column was
moving on. There was scarcely time to ask; and, in
many cases, the people were too much frightened to answer,
or to keep track of the confusion of questions
with which they were assailed. In such cases the soldier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
seized whatever he could see that he could eat, and hurried
on. As the day wore away, these matters grew
worse. Taking advantage of these circumstances, acts
of unlicensed plundering took place, which would disgrace
troops under any circumstances. Many gave out
and fell behind the column without the hope (and sometimes
with little expectation) of overtaking it, till it
should halt for the night. Some of these were most
dangerous plunderers. No longer under the control of
their officers, and counting every citizen an enemy, they
committed acts which they will be ashamed to remember,
and which I have no desire to record.</p>

<p>Under ordinary circumstances, the less revolting acts
of this kind which attended this march would be deserving
of no apology. But most of them in this case were
caused by absolute hunger. We had not had enough to eat
since arriving at Kirksville, and now that we had begun
a vigorous march our hunger was almost insufferable.
Surely it is not hard then to understand that we could
not resist taking food from hostile citizens. General
Hurlbut used his best endeavors to correct these irregularities;
but, in consequence of a hurt he had received
on the day of the review, he was compelled to ride in
a buggy, and was not able to put forth much exertion.</p>

<p>A march of sixteen miles brought us at dark to the
little town of Wilsonsville, where we halted for the night.
Some bread that had been baked at Kirksville and
brought along was issued to us. There was not enough
for supper and breakfast, but it helped us greatly. The
quartermaster promised us fresh beef, but it was slow,
very slow in coming. Our patience became exhausted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
In place of beef we took chickens. The town and surrounding
country were our commissariat. We sent in
no <i>returns</i>. We needed no issuing clerk. We drew from
the henroosts by the <i>tail</i>. A strong camp guard was
established with orders to let no one out except at the
gate with vessels for water. But we found it very easy
to go out, with a camp kettle for water, and to return
with chicken soup all ready, except what could be
done by fire and seasoning. Thus we behaved that night
at Wilsonsville; and though we were very quiet about
our depredations, and limited ourselves to supplying
our actual wants, the people pronounced us vandals.
But they saw only the outward manifestation; they
knew nothing of the inward cause.</p>

<p>The column moved at daylight, our regiment in advance.
A march of eighteen miles brought us to Bear
creek, a tributary of Salt river, where we bivouacked
in a timbered bottom. Again, as last night, we had
nothing in our haversacks to eat. There were but two
or three houses near, and guards were placed over them
to prevent plundering, and we were compelled to wait
till something was issued to us. Food came at last, in
the shape of some fresh mutton and musty corn meal.
We stewed the meat, made the meal into mush, and ate
them both fresh; for we had no salt. Many were then
suffering from diarrh&oelig;a, and were unable to eat their
food at all; but went to sleep without supper hoping to
be able to procure something they could eat at the
houses we should pass, and so endure the march. The
dust had filled our shoes, and there were few among us
whose feet were not blistered. The creek on which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
were camped, like all the streams of North Missouri,
was muddy and full of logs. But its waters were cool
and afforded us a bath, which, under the circumstances,
was indeed a luxury.</p>

<p>Several days previous to our departure from Kirksville,
we had had rumors of Colonel Moore marching
from Edina to join us. Some may have supposed that
General Hurlbut was waiting for Moore to march upon
Green from the opposite direction, and that his proclamation
was intended to delay the retreat of the latter,
till this could be effected. Events were transpiring
which tended to make this supposition probable. Scouts
arrived during the night from Colonel Moore, with the
information that he was marching in the direction of
Bethel in pursuit of Green. This news was very cheering,
although we knew that Grant was twenty-five miles
ahead of us, and that his force being mounted, we could
not possibly overtake him.</p>

<p>At eight in the morning, we resumed the march, and
having proceeded about thirteen miles arrived at two
in the afternoon, at Bethel, a beautiful free labor village,
inhabited entirely by Germans. These people seemed,
indeed, models of good citizens. Every one seemed
comfortable and prosperous. Their town was built of
brick, and there was no air of dilapidation about it such
as characterizes nearly all the interior towns of the
South. The reason was obvious&mdash;there were no negro
huts adjacent to the comfortable residences. Vice
accompanies indolence whether among rich or poor;
virtue is the companion of industry. There never was
a better illustration of this truth than this little community.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
They seemed to live in perfect harmony with
themselves and the world around them. Hitherto, they
had taken little or no part in the war. True to the
thinking, honest character of the German, they had sat
unmoved, and watched the strife around them, and
smoked their pipes and thought. We call them
phlegmatic; but while thus unmoved, they were moved
the most. Every feature of the struggle must be submitted
to the slow scrutiny of reason, and every motive
which the struggle stirred within them, to the great
magistrate, Conscience. This magistrate gave his decisions
with the slowness of Justice. When he had
answered all these questions they would be prepared to
act. And when they began to act, the zeal of self-approbation
would quicken them; the "fire of God"
would fill them; nothing could cause them to halt or
falter.</p>

<p>They fulfilled the Scriptures in point of obeying "the
powers that be." Yesterday Martin Green was the
commanding power; to-day, it was General Hurlbut.
Yesterday Green had passed through their town; his
people, they said, had treated them quite civilly. No
wonder; such a community should be the pride of any
people. Brigands would scarcely have done less. Like
sensible people, they knew it was best to submit with
patience to evils they could not resist. Green wanted
flour and meal; he took all they had in their mill, and
paid them in rebel State scrip, to which they knew it
was useless to demur. They behaved towards his men
with respect. It was an honest respect, but it was also
that respect which is always inspired by power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>But it was plain to see which party had their sympathies.
They heard of our approach some time before
our arrival. They threw open their doors and spread
their boards. Foot-sore, weary and weak with hunger,
we entered their village,&mdash;they had enough to eat for all.
They came out to meet us,&mdash;men, women and children;
and, in that plain, artless way which tells that the heart
speaks and does not deceive, invited us into their houses
to eat and to rest. We halted and stacked arms. There
was no need of a soldier being without an invitation.
He could not walk half way through the town without
being asked by a dozen different persons. And if any
one should be so unfortunate as not to be noticed, he
had but to present himself at a door-step, and what he
wanted was known immediately. At least, he would
not be long in divining what was wanted of him; for
another plate would make its appearance on the table
as soon as there was room for it. Then there would be
a nod or a motion to him to sit down and eat. Such was
the applause with which they greeted us. It needed no
display of flags or white handkerchiefs to tell us where
their hearts were.</p>

<p>We had not been here long when Colonel Moore
arrived with seven or eight hundred men, and bivouacked
near the town. This fresh arrival did not discourage
the good citizens, but rather increased their hospitable
efforts. Before night every man of General Hurlbut's
column had received a substantial dinner and supper,
and Colonel Moore's men a supper, and many were
likewise furnished with lodgings. This was no mock
hospitality like that of the Slave aristocracy. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
was no pride or pompousness about it,&mdash;only a smile
of satisfaction at whatever was accepted,&mdash;an evidence
that it was good done for its own sake. The soldier
received the same as the officer. No one stopped to ask
him what his rank was. It was sufficient to know that
he was a soldier and that he was hungry.</p>

<p>I believe that our behavior towards these people was
in all respects creditable. We parted as we had met,
friends. They taught us a lesson and gave us something
to remember. The recollection is still in our minds;
the lesson still in our hearts.</p>

<p>Soon after Colonel Moore's arrival a new plan of
operations was determined upon. Smith and Moore
were to pursue the enemy who had retreated toward the
railroad in the direction of Monroe, while the General
with our regiment, Madison's artillery, and such of the
Sixteenth as were judged unable to further endure the
march, were to proceed directly south and strike the
railroad at Shelbina. This plan of course comprehended
the idea of abandoning the pursuit as soon as we should
reach the railroad; for it was evident we should not
overtake Green.</p>

<p>In Smith and Moore General Hurlbut had yoked
together two characters directly opposite. Smith was
tardy and irresolute; Moore fiery, energetic and hopeful.
The one would push ahead with might and main;
the other would drag behind. "Come," said Moore to
Smith, that night at the hotel, "a big work is before us;
and we have no time to lose." Smith replied, with two or
three whiffs of his pipe, and Moore dragged him along.</p>

<p>Reveille sounded at an early hour. We breakfasted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
as we had supped, with the good people of Bethel.
About 8 o'clock our column moved in the direction of
Shelbyville, county seat of Shelby county. This place,
only five miles distant, was reached by ten o'clock, and
we halted, and under the luxuriant shade trees of the
court house square rested, while General Hurlbut got
out another proclamation! I need not say what the
officers and men thought of this. If the General did not
know, it was not their fault.</p>

<p>About 2 P.&nbsp;M. we again moved. As we were about
to march, we received the startling intelligence that a
member of our regiment who had straggled ahead had
been shot. This proved to be true. Three men had
straggled ahead when the column halted, and when
about three miles from Shelbyville, had been waylaid
by citizens, and one of them shot dead, another slightly
wounded, while the third escaped and brought back the
report. This accident induced the precaution of throwing
out skirmishers while passing through the spaces of
timber that lay across our route. This was soon abandoned,
it being concluded that the accident was only the
work of malicious citizens. We passed the body of our
unfortunate comrade as we walked along. It was a
visible and solemn lesson to those who were not disposed
to respect discipline and obey orders. It was
put in a wagon and brought with us. We buried it
next morning with the usual honors.</p>

<p>About five o'clock a storm came up from the northwest,
and the rain fell in torrents. This only hightened the
boys' glee. Our gait was accelerated, and with loud
yells and constant peals of laughter, we entered Shelbina.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
It was quite late before we could draw any rations; and
the occurrences of the night at Wilsonsville were repeated,
and perhaps in a more aggravated manner.</p>

<p>The next morning broke misty and lowry. But by nine
o'clock it had cleared off, and the face of nature again
looked cheerful. What was now the situation? Green
had crossed the railroad near Monroe and was continuing
his retreat. He had a wide field before him; but
if all the means by which he could have crossed the
Missouri had been seized, and a vigorous pursuit continued,
he might have been captured or his band dispersed.
At the same time Colonel Williams was in the
direction of Paris, returning from an expedition which
we will discuss in the next chapter. Nevertheless, we
did not stay to support him; but leaving him to the
mercy of Green who, there was every reason to believe,
would proceed in that direction, we got aboard two
trains of cars and moved toward Brookfield. We had
proceeded but two or three miles when the train in advance
was fired into by a concealed enemy. About
thirty shots were fired; but no one was hurt. We halted
a short time and made an unsuccessful search for them.</p>

<p>When we arrived at Brookfield we found that our
tents had been occupied in the absence of Colonel Williams,
by recruits for Colonel Morgan's regiment. We
were admonished by the sick comrades we found here to
give them a thorough cleansing before going into them.
But in spite of all our efforts in this direction, we soon
had the felicity of making the acquaintance of that charming
little insect with whose habits and instincts every
soldier is supposed to be familiar.</p>

<p>While we were marching from Kirksville to Shelbina,
Colonel Williams received an order, it is said,
from General Fremont, the precise nature of which I
am not able to give. However, he collected his available
force, which consisted of the fifty well men left at
Brookfield by Colonel Scott, as many of the sick as had
convalesced during the subsequent two weeks, and sixty
men of Company C, who had been watching the enemy
in the vicinity of St. Joseph. With this force he proceeded
to Hannibal, where he was joined by six companies,
or rather by a remnant of six companies of the
gallant Second Kansas, decimated by losses at Springfield
and the sufferings of the hard campaign of the
Southwest, and now returning home by this route to
recruit their numbers and rest. This battalion, one
company of which was mounted, together with a company
of Missouri cavalry under Captain Dolan, increased
his force to 630 men; with which he returned as far as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Shelbina, where he arrived at nightfall, and leaving the
cars began an immediate night march toward Paris, the
county seat of Monroe county, a flourishing inland
town, where he arrived about daybreak and bivouacked
for the day. Learning from reliable citizens that the
enemy was in the vicinity with 1,200 men, he threw out
pickets in the outskirts of town, and sent out the cavalry
to reconnoiter. The latter had an affray with the enemy,
and lost an officer captured.</p>

<p>That night both Colonel Williams and Lieut. Colonel
Blair, were too much under the influence of liquor to be
in a condition to command men. Colonel Williams is
said to have behaved most ridiculously. He had his
headquarters in the office of the Clerk of the Circuit
Court. He told his officers that the force was in imminent
danger of attack, and that they must not think
of sleeping during the night. As to himself, he was so
worn out with fatigue and anxiety, that it would be
absolutely necessary for him to get a little sleep in
order to be prepared for emergencies that might arise!
The officers of the Third Iowa consulted together and
decided that Colonel Williams was not in a fit condition
to continue in command. Whereupon they reported
this fact to Major Cloud, who informed them that Lieut.
Col. Blair was in a like condition, and that he had
already assumed command of the Kansas troops, and
would assume command of the whole force; on which
they mutually agreed to obey him should anything occur
during the night. Before morning the camp was
alarmed by the firing of the pickets, and the troops took
position for action. Colonel Williams is said to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
rode around the lines and delivered a few drunken orders,
which were not heeded, the officers obeying Major Cloud.</p>

<p>Whatever we may say in justification of Colonel Williams'
conduct on the following day, we do not attempt
to justify this night's debauch. In this, both he and
Lieut. Col. Blair committed a fault for which they
should have been dismissed from the service. It was one of
those faults which amount to a high crime. They got
drunk in the presence of a superior enemy, and when
they were expecting him to attack the forces under
their command. That was the crime. The situation of
this little force at best was a dangerous one. That very
day Green crossed the railroad in his retreat from
Hurlbut. That he united with the rebel force in the
vicinity of Paris, and designed attacking Williams while
in this isolated position, subsequent events place beyond
doubt. Had the latter remained at Paris till noon the
following day, it is certain that Green would have
inflicted a heavy disaster upon him.</p>

<p>As it was, he began to retreat early in the morning
toward Shelbina. The promptness and rapidity of this
movement, can not be placed to his credit; for, though
he had reason to believe he was followed, he had no
knowledge of the presence of Green. He arrived at
Shelbina about 2 P.&nbsp;M., and learned, doubtless with
regret, of the departure of Hurlbut and Scott from that
place for Brookfield the previous day.</p>

<p>He had not been here half an hour when a heavy
cloud of dust made its appearance in the direction
whence he had come; and soon the head of a column
of cavalry began to emerge from the long line of timber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
which skirts the prairie of Shelbina about four miles to
the south. This column, lengthening as it emerged,
came stretching over the prairie, devouring, in expectation,
the little band that was waiting to receive it.
Through this prairie runs a small brook, in the valley
of which the enemy disappeared in column and then reappeared,
a formidable line of battle a mile in length,
stretching to the north of the road and steadily advancing;
at the same time bodies of troops began to
appear to the south of the road, which, when deployed,
extended so far as to reach the railroad to the east.
The enemy now presented, with two or three slight
intervals, a line of battle two miles in length, behind
which could be seen, with the aid of a glass, a line of
infantry a half mile in length drawn up as a reserve.
Green then planted two pieces of cannon at different
points, and sent to Colonel Williams by flag of truce a
demand for the surrender of his force, giving him half
an hour to decide. "Go to h&mdash;&mdash;l!" is said to have
been the laconic response of the Colonel. He then
ordered the women and children out of the town.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he had been barricading the principal
streets with lumber and rubbish to protect his men from
the fire of small arms. At the expiration of the half
hour, all eyes were strained with expectation in the
direction of the enemy. A burst of smoke enveloped
one of his pieces, and a nine pounder shot came screeching
through the air. After several discharges with this,
he opened with his second piece, and his extended flank
began to advance, and close slowly toward our right
and left. The cavalry and two light companies of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Kansas battalion made two or three slight demonstrations
toward the enemy. An engine and a car filled
with men went to the east and disturbed his flank resting
upon the railroad. He made a demonstration on
the railroad toward the right; but an engine with two
cars filled with men went out and drove him off.</p>

<p>When the enemy first made his appearance, Colonel
Williams telegraphed to General Hurlbut a statement
of his condition, to which the General replied, telling
him to hold out, and promising to reinforce him before
night. Two hours and a half had now elapsed without
tidings of any assistance. The enemy was advancing
his pieces and drawing his lines so as to envelop our
flanks, and the situation was evidently becoming critical.
The Colonel called together his officers and asked their
advice. They were unanimously of the opinion that it
was best to move on the cars out of range of the enemy
and await the promised reinforcements. But Lieut.
Col. Blair and Major Cloud expressed their determination
to retreat with their battalion at all events. Col.
Williams then said that if he could not induce the Kansas
troops to remain, he would not remain with his own
men. He therefore ordered a retreat. The men got
hastily aboard the cars, leaving behind two or three
baggage wagons and a small quantity of camp equipage.
The enemy, before he discovered this movement, got his
artillery quite close behind the screen of a cornfield,
and began to throw grape and canister. The two trains
moved rapidly toward the west, the cavalry galloping
along on the side opposite the enemy. When the trains
reached Clarence, the first station west of Shelbina, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
twelve miles distant from it, they halted. But instead
of waiting reinforcements here, the cavalry got hastily
aboard the flat cars, and the retreat was continued with
every evidence that some one was greatly frightened.
When Colonel Williams arrived at Hudson (Macon
City), he found General Hurlbut there with about 250
men on the way to reinforce him. General Hurlbut
called the Colonel and his officers to account for their
conduct on this occasion, and his personal conduct
greatly increased the feeling against him, both among
the officers and men.</p>

<p>Col. Williams has been greatly censured on account
of this retreat from Shelbina, and there may have been
some disposed to attach a stigma to our regiment in
consequence of it. At least the name of a regiment
always suffers more or less with that of its commanding
officer. If the Colonel was to blame, his officers, and
particularly Colonel Blair and Major Cloud were not
less so; the former for advising him to retreat; the two
latter for refusing to remain with him with the troops
under their command. That he did not await General
Hurlbut at Clarence is altogether inexplicable. In continuing
the retreat beyond that place in the manner in
which it was done, there is every evidence of panic and
fright. Nothing could have been lost then by waiting
the arrival of reinforcements, or the approach of night
or the enemy. This would have supported the confidence
of the men, and given it, in the eyes of the public,
the appearance of an orderly retreat, instead of a disgraceful
flight. If he had waited till night, without the
appearance either of reinforcements or of the enemy, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
might have been wiser then to resume the retreat than
to run the risk of waking up in the morning to find
himself surrounded, as Colonel Smith had been at Monroe,
with the track torn up and the wires cut on either
side of him. This undoubtedly would have happened
to him, had he held out and remained that night at
Shelbina. In passing judgment on this affair, we have
to consider, first, that to hold out against a superior
enemy hightens the <i>morale</i> of troops; and that it especially
discourages men to be compelled to retreat from
troops for whom they have a settled contempt, such as
lawless insurgents, poorly disciplined and armed, and
whom they have come to suppress; and, second, that a
successful retreat, from whatever enemy, discourages
them less than a disaster. Finally, considering the
threatening approach of the enemy in such numbers,
the non-arrival of reinforcements, and particularly the
refusal of the Kansas field officers to remain, we can not
see wherein Colonel Williams was to blame in abandoning
Shelbina; but the flight from Clarence demands an
explanation which has never been given to the men of
the Third Iowa, who suffered a share in the general
disgrace. A more resolute commander, one whose conduct
on this occasion, as well as previously, had been
such as to inspire the respect of all his subordinates,
would not have given up the place without a severe
fight. Before what happened in this case, the example
of Sigel at Carthage or Mulligan at Lexington, would
have been far preferable. The whole thing was badly
managed. Hurlbut was to blame for not remaining at
Shelbina the day before to support Williams. Williams<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
was to blame for drunkenness at Paris, and for the imbecility
of calling a council of officers during the progress
of the action. And again, Hurlbut was to blame
for not reinforcing him more promptly and with a larger
force. To show how this affair figures in history, I give
the account found in the <cite>Rebellion Record</cite>, which is also
found in the <cite>N. Y. Commercial</cite> of September 10, 1861:</p>

<p>"This afternoon, Col. N. G. Williams, with eleven
hundred troops, Kansas and Iowa Third, was attacked
at Shelbina, Mo., by Martin Green, with from fifteen
hundred to two thousand troops. Green commenced
firing upon them with two pieces of artillery, and kept
up fire for about one and a half hours. One man,
(Federal), had his leg taken off with a cannon ball.
Col. Williams retreated on two trains to Hudson, Mo.,
leaving a number of horses and a part of his camp
utensils in the hands of the rebels. Col. Williams had
no artillery. General Hurlbut got as far as Hudson,
Mo., from Brookfield, with two hundred and fifty men,
to reinforce Williams. When he arrived there, Williams
was at Clarence on his retreat."</p>

<p>Our only comment on this is that Lieut. Schrader,
acting commissary for the force, stated that he issued
rations for 630 men, and that Green, after receiving the
reinforcements which joined him south of the railroad,
not including the riffraff who joined him for the occasion,
could not have had less than 3,000; nor could he have
made so formidable display of numbers with a less force.
The casualty mentioned was that of a captain of the
Kansas troops, who had his foot taken off by a cannon
ball while attempting to rally some Missourians.</p>

<p>The men who had been with Scott at Kirksville were
not allowed as much time to rest as they had expected.
On the morning of September 6th, we broke up camp
at Brookfield, got aboard a train of cars with our baggage
and effects, and moving eastward, arrived at Hudson
a little before sunset. Here we found Colonel
Williams and his Shelbina command, the detachment
of the Sixteenth which General Hurlbut had moved to
reinforce him, and the Second Kansas, who had just got
aboard a train of cars, and were about to start for their
previous destination, their homes. The latter told prodigious
stories of the battle of Springfield, and we looked
upon them with the respect usually given to veterans.</p>

<p>The other troops at Hudson were not yet ready to
move; but Colonel Scott pushed on and halted for the
night at Clarence. It was quite dark when we reached
that place, and we experienced not a little difficulty in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
getting our effects separated properly, and putting ourselves
in a situation to pass the night. The greatest
trouble was, that we had scarcely anything to eat.
But the town had plenty of henroosts, and our ready
hands supplied the deficiency. There were some
apprehensions, but no positive tidings of the enemy.
Early in the morning, a construction train went forward
with a guard of thirty men in command of a
sergeant.</p>

<p>After Colonel Williams retreated from Shelbina, the
enemy had ventilated his rage upon the innocent railroad
by tearing up the track, burning culverts, and
pulling down the wires for several miles either way
from that place. The principal damage done was in
the burning of the Salt river bridge, between Shelbina
and Hunnewell. The day was spent in repairing these
damages, and at night, the forces which had spent the
previous night at Clarence and Macon under Hurlbut,
Williams and Scott, formed junction with those of Smith
and Moore, approaching from the opposite direction.
Our regiment, again united, and under Colonel Williams,
moved forward early in the night to Hunnewell.</p>

<p>Meanwhile we learned to our great joy that General
Pope had arrived from the North Missouri Railway
and assumed command of the forces on this road; and
it was rumored that he would proceed immediately
against Green, who was encamped in the vicinity of
Florida, a day's march to the southwest. The rumor
was correct; and he would have moved that night,
if Colonel Smith had not been too long in getting back
from Shelbina.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>As might have been expected, the operations of the
Federal forces in northeast Missouri, which the last
two chapters have attempted to describe, discouraged
the Union people and created a general feeling of disappointment
against General Hurlbut, both among
citizens and soldiers. Both the General and Colonel
Williams were the following morning relieved from
their commands, and started for St. Louis under
arrest.</p>

<p>Daylight found the whole force assembled at Hunnewell
under Pope. We waited anxiously to see what
he would do. He still hoped to surprise Green. But
he knew that the spies of the latter might watch him,
and he accordingly adopted a ruse to deceive them.
He laid out his camp in regular order, established a
brigade camp guard, with Major Stone as officer of the
day, and, as far as outward appearances could show,
made preparations to remain at Hunnewell for some
time. The ruse deceived his own soldiers, who shook
their heads and did not like the appearance of things at
all. It doubtless likewise deceived the enemy.</p>

<p>All at once, a little before sunset, up came an order
to put four days' rations on the wagons and get ready
to march immediately. At dusk the column took up
the march in a splendid manner. Every step was
elastic, and every heart was full of joy and hope. We
were about to do now what we had longed to do at
Kirksville. Nothing but some egregious blunder on
our part, or extreme watchfulness on the part of the
enemy, would hinder success.</p>

<p>But General Pope, notwithstanding his skill and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
energy, had made one mistake. He had taken too long
a train. Two days' rations would have sufficed instead
of four. Should he succeed in surprising the enemy,
the fight would not last long. Should the enemy
retreat either before or after a fight, it would be useless
to pursue, unless it were intended to undertake a general
pursuit. The wagons, continually halting, embarrassed
and impeded the march. Had the train been half as
long, we could have moved with much more rapidity
and ease.</p>

<p>After keeping the main road two or three hours, we
followed by-roads or moved over fields and rough
prairies, which rendered the marching tiresome in the
extreme. About three o'clock in the morning we
crossed Salt river and found ourselves in the streets
of Florida. The different battalions twisted themselves
together in all possible confusion, and the men, heedless
of everything, threw themselves down in all manner of
shapes to rest.</p>

<p>But where was Green? He was camped on a wooded
bottom three miles below, and the road leading to his
camp was on the opposite (east) side of the river. Only
three miles off and we were halting! Was it to take
rest before falling upon him? or had General Pope
missed the way? Probably the latter; for we soon
countermarched, crossed the bridge and moved rapidly
down the river. Was the enemy there? The citizens
said, yes. An old negro, who gazed at us with
astonishment, said they were there last night. Soon
we heard the crack of muskets. They were certainly
there; for Lieut. Call was driving in their pickets.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
It was our hour of glory. What had we to fear? We
were three regiments and four pieces of cannon besides
the Home Guards, and following a brave and skillful
leader. They were a half organized horde, armed with
citizen's rifles and shot guns. Soon we would have
victory for the stigmas and sufferings of the past.
Seldom have men felt more joy.</p>

<p>Suddenly we were in the enemy's camp; but the
enemy was not there. Our feelings experienced a
sudden shock of disappointment. Victory, glory,&mdash;a
moment ago almost within our possession, now lost.
Each man felt as though he had suddenly lost a fortune.
But this is a tame comparison; for what is money
compared with the reward of the soldier who participates
in a successful battle? The enemy was gone;
he had taken everything. Nothing was left but a
United States baggage wagon, about ten bushels of
unshelled corn and a broken shot gun. A few coals
smoldered beneath the ashes of his camp-fires. Every
thing indicated that his scouts had informed him of the
movements against him, and that he had evacuated
early in the night.</p>

<p>Those who participated in this affair will not recall
without a smile the report of General Fremont to
Adjutant General Townsend concerning it. It represented
Pope as having defeated Green, capturing his
baggage, besides recapturing that lost by our forces at
Shelbourne (Shelbina); that his infantry was exhausted
but his cavalry pursued. It is needless to say, that
these statements were entirely without foundation. The
only cavalry the General had was a few Home Guards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
armed with muskets and mounted on farm horses. It
is true that they pursued; but they did not overtake the
enemy. It is also true that the infantry pursued; that
is, a great many small straggling parties went out in
the direction of the enemy, levied contributions of warm
meals upon the inhabitants, and captured animals of
various sizes, from chickens in pin feathers up to horses.
General Pope observed this conduct on the part of his
men with deep regret. But he doubtless felt a little
indulgent toward us, as every good commander will feel
toward his men when they have done something praiseworthy.</p>

<p>His men needed rest. He accordingly posted no
infantry guard&mdash;only kept his mounted men on the line
of the enemy's retreat. This will account for an incident
which occurred during the afternoon, and of which
my comrades have a vivid recollection. A party of
rebels, probably a detachment of Green's main force,
rode leisurely into our camp. Colonel Moore was the
first to discover them, and to recognize them as enemies.
He sprang to the nearest stack of guns, seized a musket,
and fired at the advanced man, giving him a mortal
wound in the breast. A number of soldiers imitated
his example, and another man was wounded; but the
remainder fled in amazement and consternation. Toward
night the column marched back to Florida and
camped. Here, also, a number of depredations were
committed on the property of rebel citizens. Consequently
for the return march the following day, General
Pope issued an order requiring the commandants of
regiments to ride in the rear of their respective commands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
and allow no soldier to leave the ranks except
in case of absolute necessity; and that whoever should
break ranks to plunder should be shot. This order did
not sound at all pleasant to some of us, but it was nevertheless
obeyed. The march was begun early. The day
was cool, and three o'clock found us at Hunnewell. We
found that the camp of our regiment had been removed
to the Salt river bridge by the guards and men left with
it, for the better protection of that work. We joined
them, tired and foot-sore enough.</p>

<p>After a fruitless chase that had promised such
splendid results, we could not but have a feeling of disappointment.
The enemy had not out-generaled us;
he had out-marched us. We needed cavalry. Of what
avail was it for a man to take his household goods on
his back and endeavor to catch a horse? We must
have dragoons to ride down and saber to pieces the
mounted forces. This was the universal opinion among
us. Our campaign against Green had taught us to value
cavalry. At this time it seemed that the whole country
was agreeing with us. "The man on the horse" was
the rage, both in the army and out of it. The War
Department was increasing the cavalry force to 75,000.
We had rumors, too, that General Pope proposed to
mount two or three regiments, including ours, and with
them clear north Missouri of all irregular forces. The
mere mention of it threw some of us into ecstacies.</p>

<p>But this expectation was suddenly disappointed, when
the following morning our regiment got aboard a train
of cars with all its baggage, moved westward and camped
at Macon City. We did not lay out a regular camp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
here. No one expected that we would remain long.
It seemed as though we were only waiting for further
orders.</p>

<p>The following day, September 12th, General Sturgis
arrived from St. Louis, by way of the North Missouri
Railroad, with four companies of the Thirty-ninth Ohio.
General Pope also arrived from Hunnewell with the
Sixteenth Illinois. These two brigadiers established
their headquarters in the same hotel. It now looked
like work. Fremont had sent two of his best generals
to command the forces here. We had seen enough of
Pope to have confidence in him. We knew that Sturgis
had won laurels at Springfield. We had read unbounded
praises of him in the St. Louis papers. His presence
gave us great confidence in future movements.</p>

<p class="center">BATTLE OF BLUE MILLS LANDING.</p>

<p>We expected that the troops now under these two
generals would be directed in pursuit of Green. In this
we were disappointed. There were now far more important
movements on foot, but of which we could conjecture
nothing. Both the Sixteenth Illinois and the
detachment of the Thirty-ninth Ohio were sent west
under Smith. This seemed a little strange; but in
reality it was not at all so; for we had already learned
that the enemy had captured St. Joseph, and we had
just received intelligence of the Platte river bridge
tragedy with which the country is familiar. The Twenty-seventh
Ohio and the additional five companies of the
Thirty-ninth Ohio arrived by way of the North Missouri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
Railroad, and, under Sturgis, proceeded west as far as
Utica, when leaving the railroad, they moved south
toward Lexington. I have been unable to ascertain the
orders under which these columns moved. There is a
chaos about the loss of Lexington, out of which it is
scarcely possible to bring any thing tangible or intelligible.
It seems, however, that General Pope had control
of the movements designed to reinforce that garrison
from the north, and that General Sturgis was under
his command. Be this as it may, the dispositions were
faulty in the extreme. It seems that the Union Guards
designed reinforcing Mulligan from the line of the Hannibal
and St. Joseph Railroad, and, at the same time,
driving out the rebels from the vicinity of St. Joseph.
Col. Smith, whom we supposed sent to effect the latter
purpose, proceeded as far west as Platte river bridge,
nine miles from St. Joseph, and commenced repairing
it. Why he did not proceed against the enemy is inexplicable.
If his force was insufficient, why was our
regiment still lying at Macon? Above all, why were
these movements delayed a day when Lexington was in
such peril? Such questions will ever recur to us when
we remember what an annoyance the operations of the
western army received in the surrender of that garrison.
The rebels began to retreat from the vicinity of St.
Joseph, and what then? Why, it was now time to
organize pursuit!</p>

<p>For this purpose, the Third Iowa was to go west
and co-operate with Smith. On the morning of
September 15th, Colonel Scott received orders to this
effect, and, in less than two hours those of the regiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
who were able to endure a forced march were aboard a
train of cars and proceeding rapidly toward the west.
The Colonel compelled many partially ill or convalescent,
who wished to join in the movement, to remain
behind; because he expected to perform rapid marches,
and did not wish to be embarrassed by straggling.</p>

<p>At 1 P.&nbsp;M. we arrived at Cameron, a station about
forty miles east of St. Joseph, and got our effects off the
train. Here we heard the first rumors of Price's movements,
and began to have glimpses of what was before
us. Colonel Scott's orders from General Sturgis were
to leave the railroad at Cameron, march upon Liberty,
act against the rebels and co-operate with Smith. The
plan seems to have been that Smith and Scott should
unite at Liberty, defeat the St. Joseph rebels and capture
their immense train before they could cross the
Missouri; and then, following them down the north
bank of that stream, unite with Sturgis, who would then
be able to appear before Lexington in such force as to
raise the siege. It is easy to see wherein this plan was
defective. It involved, first, a division of our forces in
the presence of an enemy who was numerically our
superior; and, secondly, the accomplishing of two
objects almost simultaneously when the whole force
should have been concentrated for the accomplishment
of the main one, the relief of Mulligan. As will be
shown in the following pages, the faults in executing
were not less than those in planning, and the whole
thing was a total and disgraceful failure, relieved only
by two bright tints of glory, the heroism of Mulligan at
Lexington and of Scott at Blue Mills. In justice to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Colonel Smith, however, it is proper to state here, that,
as will be seen by the <cite>St. Louis Republican's</cite> account,
given in the next chapter, orders to proceed to Lexington,
after cutting off Boyd and Patton, did not reach
him at all.</p>

<p>We were not long getting our baggage and effects off
the cars. But how were we to move without transportation?
Colonel Smith had taken our wagons from
us on a previous occasion, and still had them. Colonel
Scott, with his characteristic energy, set himself to work
to solve this problem. Before the men had got their
dinners, he had put into requisition several teams belonging
to citizens, on which we loaded our subsistence
and the few cooking utensils we took along. We were
joined by a detachment of Captain Schwartz's Missouri
Battery, fourteen men and a six pounder, under command
of a sergeant.</p>

<p>At three o'clock, we began to move. It had been
raining slowly since noon; but, though the roads were
slippery, the mud was not deep, and the wagons and
artillery proceeded without difficulty. After a steady
march of seven miles, we bivouacked on an open meadow.
It continued to drizzle slowly till sunset, and finally
the wind rose in the northwest, damp and raw, which
rendered the night very comfortless. The common
ration of food being found insufficient to satisfy our
hunger, Colonel Scott humanely and wisely ordered
extra issues to be made.</p>

<p>The march was resumed at an early hour. The
scenery through which we passed this day was sufficiently
pleasing to repay even the toils of the tiresome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
march. The day was clear and warm, and by noon the
roads were quite dry. We halted for dinner and rest
at the small town of Hainesville. As will be seen by
Colonel Scott's official report, it was from this point
that he sent his first messenger to Smith. [What became
of these messengers? Were they captured by the
enemy? Or were they too timid to go far? To suppose
that they were unable to find Colonel Smith would be
preposterous.]</p>

<p>After a short rest, we resumed the march, and arrived
at Centerville at sunset. We had scarcely stacked arms,
when we heard toward the west the firing of cannon.
Every pulse beat quicker. There was not a man who
did not listen with interest. Every jar seemed an
earnest of something to come. Each seemed to tell
of human passions broke loose, of men turned demons,
of carnage and of death. There was to us a strange
romance in those sounds. We rejoiced; for we knew
that in that direction were both friends and foes. That
the latter were there, gave us a double joy. We would
meet them, and wipe out the unjust reproach of Shelbina.
We would show the country, that under a brave leader,
we were no cowards. We would make good our promises
to our friends and loved ones at home. We would
earn the right to be called comrades of the gallant men
who fought at Springfield. The fact that friends were
there, gave us the assurance that we should not meet
the enemy alone and without hope of success.</p>

<p>We found Centerville almost entirely deserted. The
inhabitants were rebels. They had heard of our approach
and fled. Nothing belonging to them, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
was disturbed except their henroosts. It requires no
more than the teachings of ordinary experience to show
that pilot bread and fat bacon will not support great
fatigue. The country through which we passed supplied
us in a measure with what our commissariat lacked.
No one went beyond the bounds of reason, and the
people were surprised that we took so little. Thus
every man had plenty of good food; his blood flowed
vigorously; and what, under other circumstances,
would have cost him great fatigue, he now endured with
comparative ease.</p>

<p>Colonel Scott sent another messenger to Smith, and
Lieut. Call reconnoitered as far as Liberty. He reported
the enemy marching through that place. This was sufficient
to determine Scott. The sound of Madison's
guns convinced him that the enemy was closely pursued.
He was determined, that, if decisive results were not
attained, it should not be through any fault of his.</p>

<p>Accordingly the drums beat reveille at two o'clock.
We breakfasted hastily, and at three the column was
in motion. There was an inspiration in this hurried
march which the memory loves to recall. Colonel Scott
since said in a private letter, "My impression at this
moment of the proudest conduct of the old Third runs
me back to the morning of Sept. 17th, '61, driving in
the rebel pickets, and, with the eye of an eagle and the
tread of a wild stag, closing up that heavy march and
advancing upon Liberty, in the expectation of meeting
thousands of rebels at any moment." At sunrise we
came in sight of Liberty. There were indeed enemies
at hand, but no friends. Lieut. Call drove the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
rebel pickets through the town, and we bivouacked on
the hill overlooking it from the north. But where was
Smith? Colonel Scott could not suppose that his last
messenger had not reached him. He accordingly waited
with great impatience for his arrival. Nine o'clock&mdash;ten&mdash;twelve;
but no tidings from him.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we heard the firing of cannon in
the direction of Independence. This led us to believe
that troops from the other side of the Missouri were
engaging the enemy while he was attempting to cross.
Colonel Scott seems to have been convinced on this
point; for it had been his understanding before leaving
the railroad, that troops from Kansas City were to co-operate.
There was no mistaking the sounds. Six
discharges were heard, loud and distinct. Besides,
citizens actually reported that a fight was taking place
on the other side of the river. This left it impossible
for Colonel Scott to doubt that such was the case. He
was, then, governed by two considerations: <i>First</i>, our
friends were engaging the enemy and needed assistance.
To hesitate or delay could not receive too much reproach.
<i>Second</i>, if the enemy was not entirely across,
he was divided by the river. Thus it was not only an
absolute duty to attack at all hazards; but, in doing
so, it was probable that he would be able to strike a
decisive blow. Nevertheless, it was plain to see,
that the undertaking involved great hazard. The lowest
reports of the citizens placed the enemy's force at 3,000
men, with three pieces of cannon. Universally hostile
to us, and chagrined that their friends had fled before
so small a force, it is reasonable to suppose that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
represented his numbers less than they really were.
But Colonel Scott accepted the hazard and determined
to attack without delay. It was a resolution worthy
of our old commander, and every soldier rejoiced to
join in executing it.</p>

<p>This was between the hours of one and two. Colonel
Scott started a messenger to Smith, and ordered the
men to fall in. In a few minutes the regiment was
marching through the town, keeping a buoyant tread
to martial notes that had never sounded so sweetly
before. The people, mostly ladies&mdash;for there were few
men to be seen&mdash;gathered upon the street corners and
watched us as we passed. We were marching to attack
their sons and brothers, and yet in our enthusiasm, we
thought we could see a gleam of admiration in their
eyes. We subsequently learned that we were not
deceived. We almost fancied we heard them murmur;
"Those are five thousand; these, five hundred. Ah, how
great the odds! Brave men! with what a tread they
march forward to slaughter and defeat! But they are
enemies, and it must be so."</p>

<p>I can imagine, too, the feelings of Colonel Scott, as
he rode at the head of these devoted men. I believe he
recognized in the coming hour not only duty but glory.
There are moments in men's lives when a vigorous blow
seems to revolutionize their destiny. The man who
watches for these moments, who hails them in the distance,
who recognizes them when they arrive, and who
then strikes, may almost be said to be master of his
fortune. It is given to few men to command a force,
acting independently against an enemy, when there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
an opportunity to strike a decisive blow. Colonel Scott,
then, doubtless recognized this as his hour of destiny.
And such it was; for though success might not attend
the blow, a failure to strike quickly would bring upon
him the imputation of cowardice, and consign his name
to irreparable disgrace. His force was small; but to
each man the hazard was no less, than if they were a
hundred thousand. Besides, it was at a period of the
war when we had not begun to fight great battles; but
when small successes made generals, and gave opportunity
for greater ones. It must have been an anxious
hour to Scott. But he was equal to it, and rode on,
cool and firm as a Roman.</p>

<p>Lieut. Call with his mounted Missourians had the
advance. They encountered the enemy's pickets about
two miles from Liberty, drove them in and closely followed
them. Anticipating this, his rearguard, a battalion
of cavalry under Colonel Childs, ambushed
themselves in a ravine behind a dense thicket, having
previously picketed their horses in the rear, and awaited
their approach. The Lieutenant and his party rode
almost on to the muzzles of their guns, when the rebels
discovered themselves by a simultaneous volley, which
emptied five saddles, killing four men instantly and
wounding a fifth. What was to be done? The enemy
was dismounted and posted. The Home Guards had no
sabers, only muskets, and could not charge. It was a
trying moment; but they fully vindicated their courage.
Not a man drew rein to retreat. They returned the fire,
and only retired at the command of Lieut. Call. In this
encounter, Capt. Cupp of the Home Guards was killed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Capt. Hawk was also wounded in such a manner that
it seemed half a miracle that it did not kill him. A ball
struck him full on the corner of the forehead, but by
some means glanced, and spared the gallant Captain's
life. This affair won for Lieut. Call's Home Guards
our highest respect; for it taught us that they were
brave men.</p>

<p>The four ghastly bodies, as we passed them, were
visible presages of what was to come. Near the scene
of this occurrence, Colonel Scott halted the battalion,
and brought it to a front. He ordered us to inspect
our ammunition, and untie the bunches in the lower partition
of our boxes. He then gave the command to load,
and rode along the line cautioning the men to be steady
and fire low. He caused the artillery to take position
in the center of the column, and a company of infantry
to be deployed forward as skirmishers. He ordered the
mounted men to bring up the rear as a reserve.</p>

<p>These dispositions being made, the column continued
to advance. It will be remembered that, at this point,
we were perhaps half way between Liberty and Blue
Mills Landing; two miles from either place. We were
in a wooded bottom which continued to the river, interrupted
by one or two small corn-fields. The timber was
very dense, and the fallen trees and tangled vines rendered
it almost impenetrable. It would be impossible
for a battalion deployed in line to advance through it
with any degree of rapidity or order. This induced
Colonel Scott to keep the battalion marching by the
flank in the road, and to trust to the skirmishers to
discover the enemy in time to allow him to make dispositions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
to attack him. Thus, making frequent halts to
relieve the skirmishers with fresh companies, we felt
our slow way forward.</p>

<p>That the character of the ground in a manner compelled
us to advance thus, proved to be the chief misfortune
of the day. We however reached a point before
finding the enemy, that presented a favorable opportunity
for preventing this. The road on which we advanced
led north and south. We came to a square corn
field lying to the left of the road and bordering upon it.
On the south side of this field came a heavily traveled
road from the east, entering the one on which we were
marching at right angles. On the right of the north and
south road and about three rods from it, ran parallel to it
a slough several rods in width, unobstructed save by
occasional logs, and, at this time, dry. We were now
not more than a mile from the river, General Atchison's
report to the contrary, notwithstanding. The enemy
was between us and the river, if he had not crossed;
and being so near, it was time to begin to proceed with
greater caution. I have always believed that the Colonel's
greatest mistake was in not forming line here,
where the ground presented so favorable an opportunity,
and advancing cautiously thus, the cannon in the road,
and the skirmishers well in advance. But this is only
the opinion of a soldier, given after the battle is over.
Probably no one knew what to do <em>then</em> better than
Colonel Scott; and when it was over, no one knew what
should have been done better than he.</p>

<p>As it was, the column halted and the skirmishers
now in advance were relieved by Company B, Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Long, which was deployed forward on the left of the
road, and by twelve men of Company F, under First
Sergeant Abernethy, who were deployed forward on the
right of the road in the dry slough. Company I was
now in the lead of the battalion, next the artillery, and
then Company F, followed by the other companies. In
this order the column again advanced, with no signs
of the enemy until Captain Long is said to have reported
from the line of skirmishers that he could hear the
enemy advancing, their officers giving commands, and
the ground shaking with their tread. For some reason,
the Colonel paid no heed to this report, but rode very
coolly on, cautioning the skirmishers not to get too far
ahead. The enemy was indeed advancing, and the
skirmishers were not more than twelve rods beyond the
head of the column.</p>

<p>All at once, we heard a few sharp reports, and then
a deafening crash of musketry. It was on the right in
front of Sergeant Abernethy's skirmishers. They had
unmasked the enemy and opened fire upon him, and
with what fury he was returning it! Brave comrades!
we knew that they were suffering, but we had scarcely
time to think of them before the firing became general,
and the enemy's balls flew thick and fast along the
entire length of the column. The situation was disastrous
in the extreme. It did not require a second thought
to comprehend it. While marching to attack the enemy,
he had ambushed us and attacked us in column. All
that we could now do was to make the best of a desperate
situation. The men moved quickly to the right
and left without regard to their positions in ranks, concealed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
themselves as best they could, and began to
return the enemy's fire.</p>

<p>Colonel Scott immediately ordered the cannon forward.
It was brought forward a short distance, got
into position and fired two discharges of canister, which
are said to have done great execution. This is doubtless
the case; for the rebels were almost under its
muzzle. But they opened upon the artillerists with
rifles and shot guns&mdash;for they were within buckshot
range&mdash;and in a few moments disabled several of their
horses and killed and wounded half the squad. Soon
after this, the Colonel is said to have given the order
to "fall back a little." If such an order was given, it
was intended only for those who had got too far in advance,
and was heard by few and heeded by none. The
enemy began to push a column past our right; but this
proved a disastrous attempt; for, being exposed to the
fire of our entire column across the slough, it was soon
scattered and beaten back. Company I was particularly
prominent in this. Colonel Scott put forth every
effort to bring the companies into line parallel with
that of the enemy; but the men could not be brought
out of the confusion, and in the noise, the commands
could not be heard. But he himself resolutely kept the
extreme advance, and his example was almost worth a
battalion of reinforcements.</p>

<p>Every moment matters grew worse. Out of sixteen
commissioned officers ten had fallen. The cannon was
totally disabled. The enemy, though he had been
checked in his charges on our front, and in his attempt
to flank our right, had fallen back to his cover, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
bullets rained as thickly as at first. We began to give
back slowly, keeping up an unabated fire, and carrying
off our wounded. Only three wounded men were left on
the field. We, the men, evidently thought that it was
"advisable to fall back." But we had no orders to this
effect,&mdash;at least, none that many of us heard, though a
dozen might have been given. We were simply repulsed;
driven out of the woods perforce; compelled to
get out of the enemy's ambuscade or stand where we
were and be shot down to no purpose. If orders to
retreat were not given, they should have been. The
enemy's long line, masked in a dry ravine, extended
around us in the shape of a crescent, and we were
exposed to a concentrated fire from its center and both
flanks. Under the circumstances, we did the bravest
thing possible; we retired slowly, disputing the enemy's
advance. Our caisson had got clogged between two
trees, and, as most of its horses were shot down, and
the enemy pressing upon it, we were compelled to abandon
it. But the cannon must be saved. Captain Trumbull
waved his sword, and called on the men around
him to help drag it off. As many seized hold of it as
could, including Lieut. Crosley, Sergeant Abernethy,
and the sergeant who commanded the artillery squad.
It was with great difficulty that it was got away, and
three men were shot while hold of it.</p>

<p>Colonel Scott who had been in the advance during
the fight, was still nearest the enemy in the retreat.
Two or three times he endeavored, but without success,
to re-form the regiment before getting out of the timber.
These efforts sadly demonstrated the advantages accruing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
in battle from good discipline among troops. We
had been too little accustomed to implicit obedience of
orders, and the tyrannical conduct of Colonel Williams
had exerted a bad influence on us in this respect.
Under the Colonel's direction, however, a number of
men, mostly members of Companies E and F, rallied;
these to the flag, their Company's colors, presented to
them by the ladies of Fayette county, Iowa, and now
borne by the gallant Lakin, one of their number; those
to their former captain, Scott, who lingered near the
enemy, so loth was he to give up the field. They formed
a platoon across the road and drove back the enemy's
cavalry which attempted to charge our rear in pursuit.</p>

<p>As soon as we reached the open ground, the battalion
was again formed. It was now nearly night. The enemy
would not attack us on open ground, and we would
not venture to attack him again in his ambuscade.
Accordingly we began to retire toward Liberty. We
soon met Colonel Smith's advance of mounted men.
A brief consultation ensued, and then the march was
resumed, and we soon reached our camp on the hill,
where we had bivouacked in the morning.</p>

<p>Col. Smith's command arrived a little after sunset.
He had left Platte City at eight in the morning, and had
taken a route so circuitous that his men estimated the
distance of the day's march at twenty-six miles; whereas,
it could have been accomplished in fifteen. He had left
Platte river bridge Sunday at nine in the morning. It
was seven miles further from that point to Liberty than
from Cameron. He had six hours the start of Colonel
Scott in pursuit of the rebels. He had plenty of transportation;
we had to impress ours. The roads were no
more muddy with him than with us. In fact, they were
not muddy to any degree; only a little slippery, and
by noon of the next day were completely dry. He had
twelve companies of infantry, four pieces of cannon and
one company of dragoons of the regular army. He had
left three companies of the Thirty-ninth Ohio to guard
the bridge. With this force he could not hesitate to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
follow the enemy closely; but at no time did he get
within a day's march of his main force. He took a
circuitous route, and bore so far to the west that it has
even been averred that he retreated from two o'clock of
one day till eight o'clock of the next, expecting that the
enemy was following him. It seems, however, that his
system of scouts was so poor (if indeed he had any at
all), that he knew nothing of the movements of the
enemy's main body, and that the rebels' rear guard,
Childs' battalion of three hundred cavalry, led him
around over the country, while their infantry, artillery,
and long wagon train of plunder were making their
escape. In this movement, Smith displayed neither
skill nor decision. No sufficient reason can be given
why he did not reach Liberty as soon as we, or, at least,
soon enough to co-operate with us.</p>

<p>It is impossible to tell with what feelings we thought
of our being compelled to fight the battle alone, and to
suffer a defeat, which might entail disgrace, because this
officer had been so tardy in his support. In this state
of feeling, we clamored loudly and with curses, to be led
back against the enemy. But Colonel Smith decided to
defer a renewal of the attack till morning, and his exhausted
troops in the meantime took quarters in the
court house and other buildings.</p>

<p>Early in the morning, Lieut. Call and his men went
forward to reconnoiter. The field was abandoned. The
enemy had crossed the river and was out of our reach.
But would we pursue to Lexington? We understood
that Price had besieged the garrison there with all his
forces. Smith was now without orders; but reason and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
duty pointed to but one course; to march down the
river and support Sturgis, who was endeavoring to succor
Mulligan. Had Smith known or acted upon the
simplest principle of defensive warfare, that forces concentrate
when threatened, he would not have hesitated
at least in placing himself in communication with that
officer. But he took precisely the opposite course.
After spending most of the following day at Liberty,
his men in the meantime plundering and outraging the
citizens, he took up the march in the evening for St.
Joseph, giving Scott an additional piece of artillery of
Schwartz's battery, under command of a lieutenant, and
leaving him under orders to return to Liberty as soon
as he had made dispositions for his wounded, at the
same time refusing him transportation to enable him to
do so; thus, as we were willing to believe, placing us
between him and the enemy, while he was making his
shameful flight. Thus, while the enemy was making an
inroad into our territory and threatening all our detachments
west of St. Louis, he divided his small force and
commenced the occupation of the country from which a
portion of the rebels had just retreated. The privates
in the ranks saw the stupidity of these movements at
the time; and it is a striking illustration of their patriotism
that, under such leadership, they were not thoroughly
demoralized.</p>

<p>Our regiment spent the day after the battle in taking
care of our wounded and burying our dead. Most of
the bodies of the dead were brought from the field and
buried in the public cemetery with military honors. The
building of the William Jewell College was converted into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
a hospital for the use of our wounded. Dr. Cool, our
assistant surgeon, and Dr. &mdash;&mdash;, assistant surgeon of
the Sixteenth, were untiring in their efforts in behalf of
the sufferers. The three wounded men left in the hands
of the enemy were taken across the river by them, but
procured next day by flag of truce. They reported the
rebel loss very severe, and the captain of the ferry boat
confirmed their statements. Other corroborative statements
have since been made, and all the evidence that
can be gathered, including the studied silence of the
rebel official report on this point, tends to convince us
that such was the case.</p>

<p>The following is Colonel Scott's official report:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right break-before">
<span class="smcap">Head Quarters</span>, 3d Reg. Iowa Volunteers, }<br />
<span class="smcap">Liberty</span>, Mo., Sept. 18th, 1861. }<br />
</p>

<p>S. D. <span class="smcap">Sturgis</span>, <span class="smcap">Brig. Gen.</span> U. S. A.&mdash;<i>Sir</i>: In relation
to an affair of yesterday which occurred near Blue Mills
Landing, I have the honor to report:</p>

<p>Agreeably to your orders, I left Cameron at 3 o'clock,
P.&nbsp;M. of the 15th instant, and through a heavy rain and
bad roads, made but seven miles that afternoon. By a
very active march on the 16th I reached Centerville,
ten miles north of Liberty, by sunset, when the firing
of cannon was distinctly heard in the direction of Platte
City, which was surmised to be from Colonel Smith's
(Illinois 16th) command. Had sent a messenger to
Col. Smith, from Hainesville, and one from Centerville,
but got no response. On the 17th instant at 2 A.&nbsp;M.
I started from Centerville for Liberty, and at daylight
the advance guard fell in with the enemy's pickets which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
they drove in and closely followed. At 7 A.&nbsp;M. my
command bivouacked on the hill north of, and overlooking
the town. I dispatched several scouts to examine
the position of the enemy, but could gain no definite
information. They had passed through Liberty during
the afternoon of the 16th to the number of about four
thousand; had taken the road to Blue Mills Landing,
and were reported as having four pieces of artillery.
At 11 A.&nbsp;M., heard firing in the direction of the Landing,
which was reported as a conflict between the rebels
and forces disputing their passage over the river. At
12 M. moved the command, consisting of five hundred
of the 3d Iowa, a squad of German artillerists and about
twenty Home Guards, in the direction of Blue Mills
Landing. On the route, learned that a body of our
scouts had fallen in with the enemy's pickets and lost
four killed and one wounded. Before starting, dispatched
a courier to Colonel Smith to hasten his command.</p>

<p>About two miles from Liberty the advance guard
drove in the enemy's pickets, skirmishers closely examined
the dense growth through which our route lay, and
at 3 P.&nbsp;M., discovered the enemy in force, concealed on
both sides of the wood, and occupying the dry bed of a
slough, left resting on the river, and right extending
beyond our observation. He opened a heavy fire which
drove back our skirmishers, and made simultaneous
attacks on our front and right. These were well sustained,
and he retired with loss to his position. In the
attack on our front the artillery suffered so severely
that our only piece, a brass six pounder, was left without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
sufficient force to man it, and I was only able to have
it discharged twice during the action. Some of the
gunners abandoned the piece, carrying off the matches
and primer, and could not be found.</p>

<p>The enemy kept up a heavy fire from his position&mdash;and
our artillery useless, and many of the officers and
men already disabled&mdash;it was deemed advisable to fall
back, which was done slowly, returning the enemy's fire
and completely checking pursuit.</p>

<p>The six pounder was brought off by hand, through
the gallantry of various officers of the Third Iowa, after
it had been completely abandoned by the artillerists.
The ammunition wagon becoming fastened between a
tree and a log in such a manner that it could not be
released without serious loss, was abandoned. The
engagement lasted one hour, and was sustained by my
command with an intrepidity that merits my warmest
approbation.</p>

<p>I have to regret the loss of many brave officers and
men, who fell gallantly fighting at their posts. I refer
to the enclosed list of killed and wounded as a part
of this report.</p>

<p>The heaviest loss was sustained by Company I, Third
Iowa Volunteers, which lost four killed and twenty
wounded, being one-fourth of our total loss. This company
deserves especial mention. Captain Trumbull,
assisted by Lieut. Crosley of Company E, brought off
the gun by hand under a heavy fire. Major Stone,
Captains Warren, Willet and O'Niel were severely
wounded, and also Lieutenants Hobbs, Anderson and
Knight. The latter refused to retire from the field<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
after being three times wounded, and remained with his
men till the close of the engagement. Among the great
number who deserve my thanks for their gallantry, I
mention Sergeant James H. Lakin of Company F, Third
Iowa, who bore the colors, and carried them through the
fight with all the coolness of a veteran. The loss of
the enemy can not be certainly ascertained; but from
accounts deemed reliable, it is not less than one hundred
and sixty, many of whom were killed. His total force
was about four thousand four hundred.</p>

</p></blockquote>


<p>This report was written the day after the battle, under
very harassing circumstances, and before any written
reports of subordinates could be received. Leaving out
some slight inaccuracies on points which could not be
thoroughly investigated then, it reflects very closely
the impression of the affair most of us had at the time.</p>

<p>I think it was nearly two o'clock when we moved
from Liberty to the attack, and that the action did not
commence before four. The manner in which he mentions
the officers is both truthful and just. Captain
Trumbull and Lieutenants Knight and Crosley attracted
the attention of all by their gallantry. Major Stone
returned to the field as soon as his wound was dressed,
and kept with us during the remainder of the action.
I think the report should also have mentioned Sergeant
Abernethy, who commanded the twelve skirmishers that
commenced the battle, four of whom were wounded, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
who was one of the first to follow Captain Trumbull in
dragging off the cannon. I am personally knowing to
the fact, that the German sergeant who commanded the
gun assisted in dragging it off. I do not believe that
any of the published accounts of this action do justice
to those German artillerists. They were almost recruits,
they and their horses untrained. They were ordered to
take the position so far in advance that they were within
buckshot range of the enemy. The road was so narrow,
that with their untamed and fractious horses, it was
almost impossible to get their gun in position at all. It
was stated by men who say they saw it, that the man
who had the primer was shot, and staggering fell dead
several yards in advance of the piece. Their post was
in the road where they could not seek shelter. Here
they stood till many of their horses and half their number
were shot down. Who could expect more, or be
surprised if, under these circumstances, some of them
were appalled. I only blame some of them, including
their sergeant, for drinking whisky several times out
of a pint bottle on their way from Liberty.</p>

<p>Colonel Scott refrained from mentioning more fully
the gallantry of the enlisted men, from a sense of delicacy
in saying too much on a subject in which he might
be supposed to be personally interested.</p>

<p>When the battle was well over, and we began to distribute,
comrade to comrade, his proper meed of praise
or blame, two names were mentioned by every tongue,
and with an enthusiasm which amounted almost to idolatry;
Scott, who led his men into the fight and followed
them out, and upon whom, riding nearest the enemy, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
eyes were turned so often with the expectation of seeing
him fall; and Lakin, who bore the colors so bravely;
totally heedless of his own safety, but thinking only of
duty; keeping the flag all the while near the Colonel,
and calling upon his comrades to stand by it. Scott's
horse was hit several times, and several balls went
through his clothes. Eight balls went through the flag
in the hands of Lakin, and a ninth one struck the staff.
It seemed half a miracle that, while so many fell in
places less exposed, these two, all the while in sight of
the enemy, escaped unhurt.</p>

<p>The following is the official report of the enemy:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Lexington</span>, Sept. 21st, 1861.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General Price</span>,&mdash;<i>Sir</i>: In pursuance of your orders
I left this place on the 15th inst., and proceeded
forthwith to Liberty, Clay county, Missouri, where I
met the State Guard on the march from the northwest,
one regiment of infantry under command of Colonel
Saunders, and one regiment of cavalry under command
of Colonel Wilfley of the Fifth District, and one regiment
of infantry under command of Colonel Jeff Patton,
and one battalion of cavalry under command of Colonel
Childs of the Fourth District. I delivered your orders
to the above commands to hasten to this point (Lexington)
with as much dispatch as possible. They marched
forthwith and reached the Missouri river about four
o'clock in the evening, when Colonel Boyd's artillery
and battalion and baggage were crossed to the south
side, where he took position, Captain Kelly planting his
artillery so as completely to command the river. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
crossing continued all night without interruption, every
officer and man using his best exertions. We received
news during the night that the enemy would be in the
town of Liberty, about six miles from Blue Mills Ferry,
at an early hour the ensuing morning. We were
crossing in three small flats, and much time was necessary
to move the large train of a hundred wagons.
Colonel Childs with his command had taken post for the
night about two miles from Liberty on the road to the
ferry. Here he engaged the enemy's advance or pickets,
killing four and wounding one, with no loss on our side.
The enemy then fled, and we heard no more of them
until three or four o'clock, when their approach was
announced in large force, supposed to be nine hundred
men with one piece of artillery, a six pounder. The
men of our command immediately formed, Colonel Jeff
Patton leading the advance, to meet the enemy. After
proceeding about three miles from the river, they met
the advance guard of the enemy and the fight commenced.
But the Federal troops almost immediately
fled, our men pursuing rapidly, shooting them down
until they annihilated the rear of their army, taking one
caisson, killing about sixty men, and wounding, it is
said, about seventy. The Federal troops attempted
two or three times to make a stand, but ran after delivering
one fire. Our men followed them like hounds
in a wolf chase, strewing the road with dead and wounded,
until compelled to give over the chase from exhaustion,
the evening being very warm.</p>

<p>Colonel Saunders, Colonel Patton, Colonel Childs,
Colonel Caudiff, Colonel Wilfley, Major Grease, Adjutant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
Shackleford, and all other officers and men so far
as I know or could learn, behaved gallantly.</p>

<p>
<span class="indent2"><span class="smcap">R. D. Atchison.</span></span><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>This report is doubtless a second-hand affair. Prisoners
since captured informed us that General Atchison
was not in the battle at all&mdash;but on the south side of
the river; that the battle was fought by Colonel Saunders
against his orders, for which this officer was court
martialed, but acquitted. If we accept certain assertions
known to be false, and make due allowance for
the bombastic style of this report, and the border ruffian
proclivities of its author, it speaks louder for us than
anything else can. It confesses the rebel force to have
been three regiments, two of infantry under Saunders
and Patton, and one of cavalry under Wilfley; and two
battalions, one of cavalry under Childs, and one (the
arm not given) under Boyd, and one battery under
Kelly; which being just recruited and with full ranks,
could not have fallen far short of four thousand men.</p>

<p>The following account of Blue Mills is from the
<cite>St. Louis Republican</cite>:</p>

<p>"The rebel forces under Patton, numbering some
four thousand five hundred, evacuated St. Joseph on the
12th September, and retreated in the direction of Lexington.
On the succeeding Monday, an expedition
under Lieut. Col. Scott, left Cameron on the Hannibal
&amp; St. Joseph Railroad with orders to co-operate with
Col. Smith in the pursuit of the secession soldiers.</p>

<p>"The column of Lieut. Col. Scott was composed of five
hundred men of the Iowa Third Regiment, a small detachment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
of Home Guards, and artillerists to work one
gun, making five hundred and seventy in the aggregate.
Simultaneously with the movements of these troops
from Cameron, Colonel Smith of the Illinois Sixteenth,
with two companies of Colonel Groesbeck's Thirty-ninth
Ohio and four pieces, left St. Joseph. Both
columns were ordered to Liberty, there to effect a junction
and combine their forces. Lieut. Col. Scott, it
appears, reached Liberty on the 17th inst., at 7 o'clock
in the morning, and waited for the arrival of Colonel
Smith until one o'clock in the afternoon. The latter
not having got up, Colonel Scott sent back a messenger,
stating that he would push forward after the enemy,
whose camp was about five miles distant, which was
accordingly done. Boyd and Patton with, as we stated,
about four thousand five hundred men, were occupying
a position in a thicket near Blue Mills Landing. The
following statement is furnished of what transpired:</p>

<p>"Our skirmishers received a galling fire and slowly
retired to the main body, when the action became general.
Our six pounder was brought to bear on the enemy,
and two shots fired which proved destructive. At this
time a heavy fire was opened upon our single gun, killing
one gunner and wounding two others. On this,
several of the remaining gunners (Germans), abandoned
their gun, carrying off the primer and fuses, rendering
the piece useless. The action continued for an hour,
when the column was slowly withdrawn, bringing off
the wounded and dragging away the gun by hand&mdash;all
the horses having been killed or badly wounded. In
addition to the loss of the Third Iowa, there were six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Home Guards and one artillery man killed. Four of
these Home Guards were killed in a skirmish about two
hours before the battle. Three of the missing are
supposed to be in the hands of the enemy and the
balance killed.</p>

<p>"It seems that Colonel Smith, owing to the heavy rains
and consequent bad roads, had been greatly delayed on
the route, and his failure to join Lieut. Col. Scott is
attributable to these causes. On the receipt, however,
of Col. Scott's message, he immediately ordered his cavalry
and mounted men to the front, and took them
forward at a rapid pace. On his arrival at Liberty
after dark, he found Scott there after having been
repulsed by overwhelming numbers of the enemy. The
men were exhausted, and as the enemy were reported
strongly intrenched, it was resolved to postpone an
attack until morning. Lieut. Col. Wilson reached Liberty
with the infantry two hours after Colonel Smith.</p>

<p>"Early on the following morning, the 18th, the combined
forces moved forward; but, on reaching Blue
Mills Landing, found that the rebels had crossed the
river and eluded them, the last detachment having gone
over at two o'clock in the morning. They had been two
days taking their baggage and stores across, and with a
ferry boat and three flats found it comparatively easy
to take their men over, especially as the Missouri is
quite narrow at that point. Thus Boyd, Patton, and
their army escaped. The loss of the rebels in the engagement
of the 17th is not known. But from the
desperation with which the Iowa boys fought, it must
have been considerable. It seems that these soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
had been somewhat chagrined at what was termed their
flight at Shelbina, although that retreat was reluctant and
under orders. They determined on the first opportunity
to show that they were not cowards, and this feeling it
was, doubtless, that actuated Lieut. Col. Scott to push
forward without waiting for Col. Smith's column. It
was not of course intended that either command was
to attack the vastly superior force of the enemy unsupported;
and in this respect the conduct of Lieut. Col.
Scott was unauthorized, though we do not hear of any
disposition to attach any blame to him. His object,
seeing that the enemy was making preparations to cross
the river, was probably to draw him out and retreat before
him in expectation of meeting a timely reinforcement
from Col. Smith. It appears that Col. Smith left
St. Joseph previous to the receipt of the full orders which
were for him, after the contemplated cutting off of Boyd
and Patton from Lexington, to move on himself to the
latter place. These directions reaching St. Joseph subsequent
to Col. Smith's departure, were sent after him by a
mounted officer, who returned without having overtaken
Col. Smith, and consequently without having delivered his
orders. The reader, therefore, who has supposed that Col.
Smith had moved to join Col. Mulligan, at Lexington, will
be disappointed to learn that in his report to General
Pope, he speaks of being about to return to St. Joseph."</p>

<p>As this book is intended to be an amusement to my
comrades, I give the version of our first battle which I
find in a book entitled <cite>The First Year of the War</cite>,
written by one of the most distinguished men of the
South, Edward A. Pollard, of Richmond, author of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
<cite>Black Diamonds</cite>, and editor of the <cite>Richmond Examiner</cite>.
I give it out of curiosity, and to illustrate
what complete falsehood and nonsense may sometimes
be dignified by the name of history:</p>

<p>"Gen. Price was informed that four thousand men
under Lane and Montgomery were advancing from the
direction of St. Joseph on the north side of the Missouri
river, and Gen. Sturgis, with fifteen hundred cavalry
was also advancing from the Hannibal and St. Joseph
Railroad for the purpose of relieving the forces under
Mulligan. About twenty-five hundred Missourians under
the immediate command of Colonel Saunders, were,
at the same time hurrying to the aid of Gen. Price from
the same direction with the Lane and Montgomery jayhawks;
and having reached Blue Mills, thirty miles
above Lexington, on the 17th of September, crossed over
their force, except some five hundred men, in a ferry-boat.
While the remainder were waiting to cross over,
the jayhawkers attacked the five hundred Missourians
on the north bank of the river. The battle raged fiercely
for one hour on the river bottom, which was heavily
timbered and in many places covered with water. The
Missourians were armed with only shotguns and rifles,
and taken by surprise: no time was given them to call
back any portion of their force on the south side of the
river; but they were from the counties contiguous to
Kansas, accustomed in the border wars since 1854 to
almost monthly fights with the Kansas jayhawkers
under Lane, and were fired with the most intense hatred
of him and of them. Gen. D. R. Atchison, former
President of the United States Senate, and well known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
as one of the boldest leaders of the State Rights party
in Missouri, had been sent from Lexington to hasten
them on to his camp. He was with the five hundred,
on the north side of the river when they were attacked,
and by his presence and example cheered them on in
the conflict. Charging the jayhawkers with shouts of
almost savage ferocity, and fighting with reckless valor,
the Missourians drove the enemy back ten miles, the
conflict becoming a hand to hand fight between detached
parties on both sides. At length, being unable to support
the fearful fire of the Missourians at the short distance
of forty yards, the enemy broke into open flight.
The loss of the jayhawkers was very considerable. Their
official report admitted one hundred and fifty killed and
some two hundred wounded. The entire loss of the
Missourians was five killed and twenty wounded. The
intelligence of this brilliant victory of the 'five hundred'
was received with shouts of acclamation by Price's
army at Lexington."</p>

<p>And now, should we approve Blue Mills? I answer
unhesitatingly, yes. Some have pronounced it a piece
of unpardonable rashness. But one more glance at the
situation; the enemy crossing the river; every reason
for believing there was a diversion on the other side;
the absolute duty of co-operating with it; the certainty
that in this event his forces would be divided by the
river; the almost certain nearness of support; the consciousness
that to attack, though defeated by overwhelming
numbers, would be honorable, and that to fail to do
so on any pretext would be a disgrace; these were the
motives which decided Scott. Who but a coward would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
have done differently? But what is more, Scott well
knew, as most of his officers and men afterwards confessed,
that, after Kirksville and Shelbina, to allow this opportunity
of a battle to pass, would have thrown the regiment
into a state of demoralization. But I will not
seek further to justify an act of which scarcely a man
complained. All felt that the battle was a necessity,
and that the only one to blame was the hesitating, halting
commander who had left us to fight it without support.</p>

<p>I am not disposed to attempt criticism on the tactical
mistakes committed on our side. It is easy to criticise
the best dispositions when the battle is over. The mistake
which drew us into the enemy's ambuscade in
column was owing as much to his skill in removing
early his rear guard and pickets, and posting his men
completely out of observation, as to the fault of Col.
Scott in not sooner deploying the column and keeping
his skirmishers farther in advance. When once there,
the situation called forth the highest powers of a commander.
All that Scott could do by word or example,
he did. Nothing less than the conduct he displayed
could have induced his men to bear the disaster so
bravely. It is no exaggeration to say that his resolution,
in making the attack, and his conduct during the action,
won for him the devoted admiration of the regiment.</p>

<p>Such was our first battle; undertaken through a lofty
sense of honor and a loftier sense of duty, against eight
times our number; beginning in mistake, sustained with
desperation, ending in retreat; a martyrdom to public
opinion, and vindication of character, a victory under
the name of defeat.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 18th, Colonel Scott sent Lieut.
Call, with most of his command to Cameron as an escort
to about fifty wounded and sick conveyed in wagons.
The following day, having succeeded in impressing an
additional number of conveyances, he took up the march
for the same place at 6 P.&nbsp;M., in pursuance of Colonel
Smith's orders, leaving the rest of the wounded, those
who were unable to ride in wagons, to be conveyed by
steamboat to Fort Leavenworth, with Lieutenant Crosley
in charge, and Sergeant Moe acting as hospital
steward.</p>

<p>A cool evening march brought us to Centerville,
where we halted for the night. It rained heavily during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
the forepart of the night; but most of us found shelter
in buildings and rested well. Colonel Scott's orders
from Smith were to take Plattsburg in his route to
Cameron; but as the Colonel wished to send his sick
and wounded to the railroad with as little delay as
possible, he chose to come out of his way with them
as far as Centerville; and from this point in the
morning; he sent them forward under a small escort
of convalescents.</p>

<p>While he was preparing to do this, a courier arrived
from Sturgis, with a dispatch for Colonel Smith whom
he had expected to find at Liberty. Not finding him
there, he had followed, and mistaking his route, had
overtaken Colonel Scott. His representations induced
the latter to open the dispatch. In it, Sturgis represented
himself as being pressed by overwhelming numbers
and without artillery, and ordered Smith to come
to his support. Scott forwarded the dispatch to Smith
who was then flying in all haste to St. Joseph. Not
knowing where to find Sturgis, or what the result would
be, he did not feel authorized to turn back with his
small force, now less than four hundred men. He accordingly
sent a dispatch to Sturgis that he would
proceed to Plattsburg, and there await orders from
him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, vague rumors of the arrival and character
of this dispatch spread among the men. Here there
was but one voice: "Let us march to join Sturgis; let
us not hesitate while our comrades are in peril." If any
felt otherwise they cloaked their feelings in silence.
We imagined that being under Smith's command, such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
an order should govern us as though it came from him.
We thought that it should have been enough to be
satisfied that had Sturgis known our situation, a similar
order would have been sent to us, and that to move on
the strength of this dispatch would meet his approbation.
We thought we should not take into consideration our
own danger, when it was our duty to relieve our comrades.
Nor could we believe there was much danger
in such a movement. We thought we could march south
upon Sturgis' line of retreat, and join him without
interruption from the enemy. But we did not understand
the situation as Colonel Scott understood it, and
knew nothing of the nature of the dispatch; and for
these reasons were unable to appreciate the considerations
which induced the Colonel to continue his march
to Plattsburg. But we know now that his conduct
throughout met the approbation of General Sturgis,
and that there always existed between them the kindest
relations.</p>

<p>Nevertheless when we turned our faces toward the
northwest, and our officers assured us that it was the
design to reinforce Sturgis, we could not understand
the manner of accomplishing this by marching directly
away from them; and murmurs arose in the ranks which
nothing less than the great confidence we had in our
colonel could have quieted. The day was cloudy and
cool, and the roads free from dust on account of the
previous night's rain. The balking of the artillery
horses caused two or three short halts. Otherwise there
were no delays. The columns moved rapidly and
steadily. Colonel Scott knew how to march men.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
He never got them out of breath. About 9 P.&nbsp;M., we
arrived at Plattsburg, and took quarters in a large
college building.</p>

<p>About sunrise next morning Scott received orders
from Sturgis to march to join him at Kansas City, and,
at eight o'clock, the column took up the march southward
toward Liberty. Murmurs again rose in the ranks.
To the enlisted men, who knew nothing of the orders
under which Colonel Scott acted, it looked as though he
was vacillating or pursuing unsteady counsels. The sun
shone clear, and the roads grew dusty; but the march
was not slackened. When men became too lame or foot-sore
to march, wagons were impressed to haul them.
Usually these impressments were made for a day or for
the trip, the owner commonly sending a driver, who
would return with the team when we were through with
it. We halted for dinner on a small stream, and in an
hour resumed the march.</p>

<p>About eight o'clock in the evening we crossed Platte
river and took quarters for the night in the little town
of Smithville. Here Colonel Smith had bivouacked on
the night of the 15th, the rebels he was pursuing having
done so the night before. It was less than twenty-five
miles to Liberty. What excuse, then, can he make for
consuming two days in this march? We found an
unfinished letter which represented the rebel force as
numbering five thousand, and stating that Smith's
soldiers behaved very badly, outraging the citizens in
many ways. We quartered in houses, and, it is to be
regretted that there was some plundering done, notwithstanding
Colonel Scott's efforts to prevent it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Citizens, however, had little reason to complain of our
presence.</p>

<p>At an early hour the march was resumed in the direction
of Liberty, and pushed at a rapid pace. Toward noon
rumor placed us in the vicinity of a large rebel force.</p>

<p>Here let us pause and look at the situation. While
the events narrated in the two last chapters were
transpiring, Price had driven Mulligan from Warrensburg
and besieged him at Lexington. Sturgis, with his
column of fifteen companies, arrived before that place
to find the enemy in possession of the boats on which
he had expected to cross to the relief of the garrison.
Price immediately sent Parsons across the river with a
strong force to drive off Sturgis and cover the siege.
The latter retreated precipitately toward Liberty, where
he expected to join Smith, abandoning to the enemy his
tents and a part of his baggage to facilitate his flight.
Parsons did not pursue far with his main force, but
kept up such a demonstration as led Sturgis to believe
he was close upon him. After securing the property
Sturgis had thrown away, Parsons was almost immediately
recalled. But the former continued to retreat in
haste, camping the first night at Camden, and reaching
Liberty at four o'clock of the next. Here he dispatched
a messenger to Kansas City for a boat, and when this
arrived the following forenoon, so little had his sense
of the danger abated, that he consumed only an hour in
moving from the town four miles to the landing, and
in getting his men and baggage aboard. He moved
twelve miles up the river, and landed his troops at
Kansas City on the opposite side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>He was thus embarking this morning, while we,
thinking him in great peril, were hurrying forward to
reinforce him. And now, very reliable information
came to Colonel Scott, that the force which had pursued
Sturgis had arrived, and camped in the fair grounds at
Liberty. Thus he supposed his way blocked, and the
road, on which he expected to reach the landing where
he would embark for Kansas City, in possession of the
enemy. There was left him but one alternative, either
to retreat or turn to the right and evade them. He
boldly chose the latter; and when about ten miles from
Liberty, we turned to the west, and at 3 P.&nbsp;M., reached
the town of Parkville on the Missouri river, having
accomplished since starting nineteen miles.</p>

<p>Here the Colonel expected to find two flatboats on
which to cross; but he found only one, the other having
been moved to a point up the river. He caused the
artillery to be planted on a ridge commanding the
approaches to the town, and left Companies F and H
to support it, while, with the remainder of his command,
he proceeded to the river, and prepared to cross on this.
The rearguard in the meantime quietly commenced
cooking their dinners. We had thus waited about half
an hour, expecting every moment the enemy, hardly
hoping for friends, when to our great joy, a steamboat
hove in sight, rounded the point and landed. It was the
<i>Majors</i>, bound for Fort Leavenworth, and had on board
General Sturgis. We were soon aboard, and the boat
resumed its course up the river.</p>

<p>When we awoke the following morning we found
ourselves at Fort Leavenworth. We marched to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
barracks and rested till about noon, sauntering about
the grounds, looking at the artillery, and talking with
the regulars. This day, reports came that Mulligan had
surrendered. We took the matter very coolly; for it
was what we had been expecting. Still it was easy to
see a gloom on every countenance. The citizens of
Leavenworth were thoroughly aroused, and a thousand
of them were drilling each day.</p>

<p>Toward evening, the <i>Majors</i> again took us aboard and
dropped down to the town three miles below the Fort.
After a short while, it again moved down the river and
landed us at Wyandott, Kansas, where we bivouacked
on the river bank for the night. The next day we took
quarters in vacant buildings. Three miles below us, Gen.
Sturgis with his previous force occupied Kansas City.
There also was a hospital containing some of our
wounded comrades. A hospital was likewise established
at Wyandott, to which a number of men were
removed. The citizens of Liberty had manifested great
kindness to our comrades while in their hands. Their
generosity was really chivalrous. Though they bitterly
hated us and our cause, they forgot for the time that
these were enemies and invaders, but looked upon us
only as unfortunate brave men, cast in a measure upon
the hospitalities of their city. I have the testimony of
Sergeant Moe, that the ladies nursed them night and
day, and that they were fed entirely upon delicacies
brought by them to the hospital. Their conduct in
this respect merits our highest regard for them as a
people, not less than our warmest gratitude. The citizens
of Wyandott, though friends, and feeling that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
they could scarcely do enough, hardly succeeded in
doing more.</p>

<p>And now on the soil of a State made free by the blood
of our brethren; at rest and at peace after some months
of watching and disquietude; after some toilsome
marches, retreats and pursuits; and after a battle
which, for the numbers engaged, was by no means contemptible;
breathing once more the air of freedom, and
enjoying the hospitalities of friends, we felt as though
we had been transported to another world.</p>

<p>The citizens of Liberty gave us great praise for our
conduct at Blue Mills, and especially for our modesty(!);
since, sulky after our defeat, we said little. We spent
four or five days at Wyandott, doing what soldiers
expressively call, "lying around." But we experienced
no <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennui</i>. It was the season of ripe fruits, and we
spent much time in rambles through the woods and
pleasant intercourse with citizens. But we did not
remain here long. Towards the evening of September
28th, news came that General Sturgis' pickets had been
attacked beyond Kansas City. We moved without delay
to reinforce him, and reached Kansas City at 8 o'clock
in the evening. Finding that the General had dismissed
apprehensions of an attack, we took quarters in vacant
buildings.</p>

<p>We remained here about three weeks, without clothing
and tents, and with but a single blanket to the man;
and as the season advanced, we suffered some from
cold. But in the midst of these discouragements, we
had much matter for contentment. We had nothing to
do but to feed ourselves and keep clean. The latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
was the most difficult task. In the former the hospitable
citizens assisted us in a manner which merits our warmest
remembrance. We had but to carry our rations to
them, and they entertained us free of charge at the best
their tables afforded. We had not been here long, when
Colonel Scott managed to procure from a bank sufficient
money to pay the enlisted men ten dollars each. In
the absence of our clothing this was most fortunate. I
need not speak of the feeling such acts of kindness created
towards him.</p>

<p>But the principal event of interest which took place
during our stay here was the arrival of Jim Lane and
his celebrated brigade. His coming was noised before
him, and when he was expected to arrive, all flocked to
get a sight of the great "jayhawker," "the Father of
Kansas." At length he appeared at the head of a part
of his troops. The citizens said it was Lane, and we
needed their assurance; for he was the last man we
would have taken for a general. He had on citizen's
pants, a soldier's blouse, and a dilapidated white hat.
He rolled under his dark brows a pair of piercing eyes,
and between his jaws a huge quid of tobacco. A general
so unostentatious, so like his men, and yet so terrible
to the rebels; the boys were struck with profound
admiration of him.</p>

<p>His men seemed to partake of the character of their
general. In such small matters as dress, every one
seemed to consult his own taste. Few among them wore
the prescribed uniform, and many were dressed entirely
in citizen's clothing, who did not ask them where or how
they obtained such articles of dress. But they entertained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
us with enormous stories, which we were not displeased
to hear, and sold us rebel caps at ten cents
apiece.</p>

<p>In personal appearance there was as much difference
between Lane and Sturgis, as between a wolf and a bear.
Everybody knows how Jim Lane looks; for everybody
has seen either the man or his picture, or some one that
has seen him. The eye of an eagle and the visage of a
wolf, thin and lean; this tells it. Gen. Sturgis, in
respect to his <i>personnel</i> was precisely his opposite.
He was thick, heavy-set and muscular. There are no
angles in his face; it is broad and round. His forehead
arching and heavy at the brows, retreats in all
directions, and is covered with a mass of jet-black,
wavy hair.</p>

<p>There was as much difference between the character
of the men as between their countenances. Sturgis
followed the army regulations and the doctrines of West
Point. He kept the business of confiscation out of the
hands of his soldiers, and left it, where it ought to be, in
the hands of the Government. He protected all citizens,
loyal and disloyal. His only line of distinction was
drawn between those who were in arms and those who
were not. While marching to join Lyon in the summer,
he ordered some Kansas soldiers tied to a cannon and
flogged for stealing chickens! He followed law and
forgot equity. His rules of warfare had this absurdity,
that he treated traitors in arms and traitorous citizens
with the giving them aid and comfort and plotting the
assassination of his soldiers with the same consideration
he would have shown to a rightful enemy. Nothing can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
be more ridiculous than to suppose that a nation fighting
its own citizens for its own existence, should pursue the
same course of policy toward them that it would pursue
toward an enemy with whom it was contending on a
mere question of international policy. By pursuing this
course, he gave aid to traitors and protected spies.
Though he was doubtless honest in all this, it is no
wonder that his own soldiers denounced him as a secessionist
and a friend of the enemy. I am inclined to
think, that his retreat from Lexington deserves less censure
than it may have received; and that it was owing
chiefly to a lack of proper information, and of a proper
system of scouts, and not to any lack of courage.</p>

<p>Lane, on the other hand, recognized military rules
only so far as they were adapted to the present situation.
He recognized the rebels as traitors, not as
belligerents. He moreover failed to see the difference
between the traitor whom he met in battle, and the
one who gave him bread and powder, except that
the former being the braver man was entitled to the
more consideration. He had no mercy for bushwhackers,
nor for men who to him were for the Government,
and to his back for the enemy. He knew no such thing
as neutrality on the part of citizens. All were for their
country or against it. Those who were for it must give
and sacrifice for its support. There was no such thing
with him as enjoying the rights and privileges of
citizenship without supporting its obligations and facing
its liabilities. Those who were against it, must feel or
shun his blows. He did not halt before small obstacles;
or delay for decisions from Washington. When the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
West Point clique at Leavenworth refused him supplies,
the enemy had to furnish them. He would make the
war support itself. The traitors who were responsible
for the contest must pay for it. Every thing must be
done which would paralyze the enemy and strengthen
the government. Whatever opposed the restoration of
our Union must fall, and those who did not like it must
stand from under. True to his friends, his country and
Liberty; hating bitterly and scourging without remorse,
his friends', his country's and Liberty's foes; such was
Jim Lane. The doctrines he applied to the present exigencies
could be reduced to the simple maxim: Crush
the rebellion by the quickest method, and in so doing
neglect not to punish the rebels. Whatever may be
said of these doctrines, the soldiers of the army of the
west believed in them with a faith which was enthusiastic,
and without reference to previous political distinctions.
Nor did they believe less in the man himself.
They idolized him, as soldiers will idolize only
the general, who, they believe, will surely lead them to
success.</p>

<p>It is said that Lane and Sturgis could not agree as
to which was entitled to the command. Of course the
soldiers knew little about this. We only knew that, for
a time, citizens going out of town obtained passes from
both Generals, and, that Lane, as soon as he had drawn
his supplies, moved away from the city like a man who
is getting away from the cholera.</p>

<p>Jemison's celebrated mounted infantry regiment, the
7th Kansas (jayhawkers) was at this time here completing
its organization. This regiment was composed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
of splendid men, many of whom had come from other
States to join it. Lieut. Colonel Anthony was provost
marshal of the city. No one would have believed, looking
into the youthful countenance of Major Lee, as he sat
about the Union Hotel, that a little over a year would
make him a general.</p>

<p>Lane and Sturgis moved to join the main army under
Fremont in the pursuit of Price. We expected to
accompany them; but our supplies were not at hand,
and we were not in a condition to go. It was without
disappointment, but with feelings of regret that we saw
successively Lane's and Sturgis' brigades move out of
Kansas City for the south, and Jennison's cavalry to
Fort Leavenworth to prepare for a winter campaign on
the frontier, and we alone remaining, waiting for transportation
to&mdash;where? To the Hannibal &amp; St. Joseph
Railroad, whence it was rumored the regiment had been
ordered to Quincy, Illinois&mdash;for what purpose? To
recruit and drill. It seems that some of our prominent
officers had obtained this order by representing that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
had suffered greatly through exposure during the summer
and losses in the recent battle, and that we had
not had that period of drill requisite to secure a reasonable
degree of efficiency. Whatever might have been
thought of this then, there can be but one opinion now.
It was humoring us; it was making children of us.
Soldiers acquire most rapidly those qualities which the
enemy most dreads, endurance of hardships and steadiness
in danger, in the field and under his fire. This
begging off for us, as it really was, from a work which
others would have to do in our stead, is a matter of
which we certainly have no reason to be proud.</p>

<p>About two o'clock in the morning of October 18th,
we were aroused by the arrival of the boat which was
to take us away. We went aboard at daylight, and soon
after were moving up the Missouri. About dark, we
arrived at Iatan and went aboard a train of freight cars.
Crowded together, and jostled about by the motion, we
went to sleep and awoke toward morning in St. Joseph.
Soon after sunrise the train moved over the railroad
towards the east. We passed Platte river bridge, the
scene of the rebel massacre of innocent citizens; then
Cameron, where we had left the railroad for Blue Mills;
next Utica, the site of our first camp in Missouri; and
then successively, Grand river, Chillicothe, Locust
creek, Brush creek, Chariton river, Brookfield, Callao,
Hudson, Clarence, Shelbina, Monroe,&mdash;places around
which clustered many recollections. When night came,
we jammed ourselves together and went to sleep, and
awakening at eleven o'clock, a sky full of stars revealed
to us the broad and placid surface of the Mississippi,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
and beyond it the glittering lights of Quincy. We
crossed on a steam ferry. There was no noise in the
city but our voices, and the clatter of our unequal
steps,&mdash;no visible life but our own and the lighted lamps.
After marching three-quarters of a mile, we reached
our camp on the north side of the city. Joyfully did
we greet the comrades we had parted with at Hudson;
and before morning many a social chat was had, and
many a thrilling tale was told around our cheerful
camp fires.</p>

<p>Our camp at Quincy was delightfully situated. We
had no pickets or patrols, only a small camp guard.
The usual time consumed in the daily drills was three
hours. Colonel Williams was yet under arrest; Colonel
Scott had obtained a leave of absence; and Major Stone
was left in command. Immediately after our arrival
we drew supplies of clothing and blankets, and appeared
for the first time in the Federal uniform. The citizens
of Quincy, with a patriotism which knew no distinction
of State or place, seemed to take pride in doing us
honor. They strove to make our stay among them
pleasant; and so well did they succeed that we shall
ever look to their beautiful city as the greenest spot in
our whole soldier-life.</p>

<p>A number of furloughs were granted to the enlisted
men, and most of the officers obtained leave of absence
ostensibly to recruit for the regiment. I need not say
that very few recruits were obtained in this way.</p>

<p>Thus we spent three weeks at Quincy; and the monotony
of camp life began to be more irksome than
tiresome marches; and we justly feared that by remaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
here, we would become an example of effeminacy,
and fall behind our comrades in glory.</p>

<p>Our regiment having received five months' pay, and,
in the opinion of some one in authority being sufficiently
"recruited," we received orders to repair to Benton
Barracks, Missouri. This was on the 7th of November.
That night the citizens gave a grand ball in honor of
the Third Iowa. It was an immense attraction. It
attracted sentinels from their posts; and at 10 P.&nbsp;M.,
there were not twenty men in our whole camp including
the guard. Those who were not attracted to the ball,
were attracted elsewhere; and a number of little incidents
occurred in Quincy that night which are not
reportable. The author of this book has a vivid recollection
of being a member of a patrol guard, commanded
by good old Captain McCall, which saw that night one
or two strange adventures. A castle on an island was
besieged and then carried by storm. The prisoners
were treated with a magnanimity which would have done
honor to Fabricius. Does any one recollect it? It was
a night of "riot most uncouth." Money flew, wine ran,
and spirits rose. The temperate men were happy, the
"bibbers" were jolly, and all of us thought we were
having the best time in the world. Amid all this joy,
bad as matters were with some, I claim that under the
circumstances we behaved remarkably well. There
are few regiments of our numbers that would not have
behaved worse.</p>

<p>The following day, we took down our tents and prepared
to leave; but something was not "ready," and
the movement was deferred another day. Early the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
morning of the 9th, we got our baggage aboard the
<i>White Cloud</i>, and the battalion was formed. We were
marched into the city and halted to hear Colonel Scott
make a speech. In the name of his men he thanked
the citizens of Quincy for their hospitality, and then he
thanked his men; all of which suited us exactly, as we
well attested with our cheers. We then shouldered
arms and marched to the levee, where we underwent the
interesting ceremony of drumming a fellow out of the
service for robbing a comrade. This likewise met our
approbation. We then went aboard the boat, and the
next morning were in St. Louis. A march of four
miles in which we suffered under our heavy knapsacks
(for we had not yet learned the nice art of "cutting
down" our baggage); brought us to Benton Barracks,
where we were assigned quarters, each company occupying
a separate apartment.</p>

<p>Benton Barracks, erected as a camp of instruction by
General Fremont, and named after his venerable deceased
father-in-law, Colonel Benton, is an institution
which, from its direct association with the war in the
West, will become historical. At some future day, the
student may wonder what sort of a place it was where
so many battalions were quartered and drilled.</p>

<p>Benton Barracks are built on what is known as the
Fair Grounds in the suburbs of the city, and about four
miles from the levee. They are so unconspicuous as
scarcely to be seen until you get within a short distance
of them. They are composed of long rows of white-washed
buildings, inclosing a rectangular piece of
ground, about three hundred yards in width by one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
thousand in length. This ground, smooth as a floor
and almost as level, is used for drills and parade.
Toward the west end of it, the open space is interrupted
by an interior row of barracks, and toward the east end,
are the commanding general's headquarters, a two story
building, painted white and over which floated a large
garrison flag. On either flank of this was a smaller
building, occupied by his staff, the whole being surrounded
by a neat paling.</p>

<p>Before the door of one of these offices, a large crowd
was seen each morning between the hours of seven
and nine. They were soldiers waiting for their passes.
Only four men a day of each company were allowed passes.
Their names were sent by the 1st sergeant of companies to
the sergeant major of the regiment, and through him to
the Assistant Adjutant General, whose clerk at this hour
made out and issued the passes to the men in person.</p>

<p>The barracks in which the soldiers were quartered
were low, windowless, and ill-ventilated. On either
side and at the ends of each apartment were three rows
of berths on which the soldiers slept on straw, generally
in ticks. To the rear of this row of buildings were
hydrants fed by the reservoir which supplies the city.
In the rear of the barracks proper, were sheds, the first
row of which served as dining rooms, the second as
kitchens. Here for the first time we cooked and ate by
the company. Our cooking was done upon brick furnaces
with an iron cover. Our simple camp utensils,
sheet iron kettles and mess pans served as cooking
vessels here as in camp. With such utensils, with
inexperienced cooks, and with gangs of cold soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
crowding continually over the furnaces, it may be supposed
that our food was not always prepared in the
most desirable manner.</p>

<p>From <i>reveille</i> till <i>retreat</i> there was a constant hubbub
pervading this little city, and the interior square presented
a scene of splendid confusion. The noises of
bugles, drums, and voices commanding; infantry, cavalry
and artillery, drilling by the multitude, and going
through their various evolutions as they could best
divide the ground among themselves. When our regiment
marched into the barracks for the first time, the
whole force, infantry, cavalry and artillery, was marching
in review before Generals Curtis and Strong. It was
a splendid sight, so many men, all in the same uniform,
and so neatly aligned, moving with such unity and precision.
In the programme of duties, inspection and
review were the order for Sundays.</p>

<p>The most exciting feature of the exercises was the
occasional mimic battles, fought generally by one regiment
against another; sometimes infantry against infantry
and sometimes against cavalry. In one of these
in which our regiment was engaged, Private McMannus
of Company A, was shot dead. The cause of the accident
could never be found out. It was probably done
by some one using a ball cartridge instead of a blank.
I believe that after this accident no more mimic battles
were allowed.</p>

<p>Such was Benton Barracks. Without, the pomp of
marching battalions, and galloping squadrons and batteries;
within, the discomfort of men, poorly fed, poorly
lodged, and jostled against each other continually in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
darkness and foul air. Pomp without and misery
within; such is the world everywhere.</p>

<p>While we were at Benton Barracks, Colonel Williams
was released from arrest. The charges which
had been preferred against him had been mislaid, and
when his case came up for trial, he was released, because
nothing appeared against him. Immediately on
assuming command, he arrested a number of officers, his
personal enemies, without the knowledge of the commandant
of the post. As soon as these facts became
known to General Strong, the officers were released,
and Colonel Williams was ordered to report in person
to General Halleck. The General informed him that
he was under arrest. When this news reached the
regiment, the exultation was very great.</p>

<p>General Sherman succeeded General Strong in the
command of the post. The regulations made by General
Curtis, the first commander, were continued. Besides
the usual fatigue and police duty, we were compelled to
drill seven hours a day. As the season advanced, while
our duties grew no less, the inconveniences of the situation
increased. Troops continued to arrive. Two
companies were compelled to occupy a barracks built
for one. Among the arrivals was the gallant Seventh
Iowa, or what remained of it after its glorious day of
Belmont. Cheer upon cheer greeted them as they
marched in, and the shout was caught up and borne to
the farthest end of the grounds. The Second Iowa was
also here recruiting from the effects of its sojourn in the
sickly swamps of Bird's Point. They were the best
drilled troops in the camp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>It is doubtful whether their change from Bird's Point
to Benton Barracks had been for the better. I do not
think our own regiment would have suffered more in
small detachments on the Hannibal &amp; St. Joseph Railroad,
or moving constantly with good tents during the
same season.</p>

<p>Very few were free from colds and coughs, and
diseases of the throat and lungs took down a great
many. When our regiment left Benton Barracks it was
as much reduced by disease as it had been at any previous
time since leaving Chillicothe. Company F, more
fortunate than the rest, had been most of the time
at the St. Louis Arsenal, where they had excellent
quarters, liberal rations, and as much liberty as they
wanted.</p>

<p>It was now Christmas. We had had three months
of drill, discipline, and rest from the fatigues of the
active campaign. Although we were loth to acknowledge
it, many other regiments had been far less favored
in this respect than we. We were heartily tired of this
kind of life, and rejoiced at the opportunity of getting
away.</p>

<p>Irregular bands of rebels, acting under the orders
of General Price, had torn up the North Missouri Railroad
and rendered necessary the presence of troops in
that vicinity. The Third Iowa was ordered there. A
number of captains of companies without the knowledge
of Colonel Scott, united in a statement to General Sherman
of the bad health of the command, and other
circumstances which rendered it unfit to go. Such a
statement, even if it had been forwarded through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
proper channels would have been reprehensible. To
plead disability, to shrink from duty, to ask to be kept
in a bandbox and nursed, argued on the part of these
officers a great lack of soldierly qualities. It had a
tendency to disgrace our regiment in the eyes of the
commanding General, and received from him the prompt
rebuke it deserved. He reported the shameful proceeding
to Colonel Scott, who gave the captains a severe
reprimand privately at his headquarters.</p>

<p>General Sherman issued an order that Christmas
should be observed in all respects as the Sabbath.
But the Third Iowa could not comply with it. It was
with us a day of preparation, tumult and glee. We expected
to move that day. The order had been read at
dress parade the previous night, that we would be ready
to move at a moment's notice with forty rounds of ammunition.
But we were delayed on account of transportation
which had not been issued to us. Those who
were unable to march on account of sickness were left
in the barracks we had occupied under charge of our
assistant surgeon, Dr. Cool.</p>

<p>At 7 A.&nbsp;M. on the 26th, our regiment marched to
the railroad depot. Major Stone was in command<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Col. Scott having been detailed on a military commission.
We waited in the cold till about noon for our
baggage wagons to be brought up and loaded on the
train. We had no rations in our haversacks; for when
we left the barracks we had nothing to cook. Finally,
to the great joy of all, the train moved out, and three
o'clock in the afternoon found us opposite St. Charles.
After many delays, seasoned with jokes, curses and cries
of "<i>bread</i>," we succeeded in getting across the Missouri
and aboard another train of cars and off. It was
worthy of note, that for the first time but one in our
experience as military railroaders, we were transported
in passenger cars. For the consolation of the inner
man, we drew from our quartermaster fifteen loaves of
bread to the company, but no "small fishes." With
these we appeased our stomachs, outraged by famine
since Christmas noon. At length night came, and we
could no longer enjoy looking at the scenery through
which we were passing: so we hitched ourselves together
as best we could (for the cars were crowded to
their utmost capacity), and went to sleep. Whenever
we awoke, until late in the morning, we could feel the
unsteady motion of the carriages. Morn broke upon
us at Warrenton. It was not a little amusing to view
the scene which daylight ushered in. Some were sleeping
on the seats, some between the seats, some in the
aisles; lying on top of each other for pillows; horizontal,
inclined and vertical; sometimes the head highest,
sometimes the heels. Loud were the barkings of incipient
consumptives; hoarse the groans of those whose hunger
was not yet appeased, and dire the vengeance denounced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
against the bridge-burners who had put us to all this
hardship.</p>

<p>The scenery through which we passed was lovely,
even in the gray shroud of winter.</p>

<p>At 10 A.&nbsp;M. we arrived at Florence, and had scarcely
finished our breakfasts, when six companies, R, E, F,
H, I and K, were ordered to get ready to march. The
remaining four companies were left to guard the place,
considered an important one; for it was the farthest
point northward from St. Charles to which the cars
could run, the track being injured and the wires cut
beyond it.</p>

<p>We, the battalion that marched, were joined by a
company of German cavalry of the 1st Regiment Missouri
Reserve Corps, and immediately moved toward the
west. A march of three miles brought us to the town
of Danville, from which a small column of Union troops,
commanded by Brig. Gen. Henderson of the State Militia,
had marched an hour previous. We followed him, but
by a shorter and less traveled road. The snow which
had fallen some days previous, was not yet melted away
in the timber, through which, most of the way, our road
led us. Night found us marching on. The sky was
clear and the stars sparkled brilliantly above us. The
keen air quickly congealed the running snow, and
rendered the hills so slippery that it was not without
much difficulty and danger that the wagons could follow
us.</p>

<p>We camped for the night on a meadow, bordering on
a small stream of excellent water and surrounded on all
sides by timber. It was ten o'clock before the wagons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
got up, and we then discovered that our quartermaster
had no bread for us. By some means the supply which
had been furnished for us had been left behind. The
quartermaster of course had to shoulder the blame. We
cooked a scanty supply of bacon, rice and coffee, and
slept in battle line away from our camp-fires, fearing a
surprise. Our bed was the frozen ground; our tents the
sky. Our thin woolen blankets furnished little protection
against the keen air. We lay on our backs, and,
if our heads were not smothered in our blankets, watched
the stars, but doubtless with different emotions from
those of the devout old Chaldean shepherds; and when
we slept, we dreamed of&mdash;Heaven knows what. Some
were at Valley Forge; one retreated all night from
Moscow; and many fled to their warm firesides at
home.</p>

<p>As morning streaked the east, we shook the stupor
of our cold slumber from our limbs, and tried to dispel
the gloom from our minds. Some of us had actually
been sleeping on four inches of snow. Our breakfast,
the same fare as our previous supper, afforded us little
cheer. At half past seven o'clock we were again on the
move. We marched slowly, doubtless, in order that
our bread wagons which were coming could overtake us.
In this we were disappointed.</p>

<p>We camped on a beautiful meadow, having made but
nine miles. The Major had some hogs killed for our
benefit; but this was not the only kind of fresh meat
seen in our camp that night. The feeling in our ranks
toward the citizens of this section was one of extreme
bitterness. We believed that they were guilty, at least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
in part, of the depredations which had rendered our
presence among them necessary. To take up arms
against us; to hide in the brush and shoot down our
stragglers; to crawl up under cover of night and assassinate
our pickets; to prowl about the country in guerrilla
bands, and attack our small detachments; to burn
railroad bridges and cut telegraph wires; to act as spies
for the enemy; to give him shelter, food and cheer; and
then, if captured in arms, to claim the rights of a prisoner
of war; if without arms, to claim protection as a
non-combatant, or, what is still worse, as a Union man;
such we knew from experience to be the character of a
large portion of the disloyal citizens of Missouri.</p>

<p>A soldier admires open enemies if they are brave.
There is nothing that he despises as he despises such
enemies as these. "Hang them if they act as spies or
bridge-burners. Subsist our armies upon them. Confiscate
their property and put it to the use of war. A
war waged against such traitors ought to support itself.
Give us such a leader as Jim Lane. Nothing short of
his policy would do. We never would end the war
until we showed traitors that we considered treason a
crime." Such sentiments were canvassed freely in our
ranks and found no contradictors. But we were only
soldiers. We could not shape the policy of the Government
in reference to the traitors. We were to execute
the will of the commanding general. We could not take
a chicken from the premises of an enemy in arms, without
violating orders from our superiors. It is a correct
maxim, that soldiers should not plunder. It is likewise
a correct maxim that an army should not suffer from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
hunger while marching through the country of men who
by acts of treason have forfeited all right to the protection
of the Government. We reasoned that the commanding
general should authorize impressments of food
for our use when we needed it as we did then. At all
events we ought not to suffer from hunger, and if food
could not be obtained properly, <i>it must at least be obtained</i>.
Such was the reasoning which prompted the
little nocturnal expeditions which went out from our
camp, in spite of the active measures of the Major to
prevent them, and which resulted in supplying some of
the necessities we lacked.</p>

<p>The following day, December 29th, was clear and
beautiful. We waited for the rear wagons till about
noon; but they did not arrive and we took up the
march. The ground thawed, and before night, the mud
was deep and the march difficult. We camped for the
night on a broad prairie near Martinsburg Station on
the North Missouri Railroad. We obtained water by
cutting holes through the ice of a pond which rests
against the railway embankment and supplies a tank.
The ice was about three inches thick. Most of us
pitched tents and pulled grass and made beds. About
7 P.&nbsp;M. we were rejoiced at the appearance of the long
expected bread wagons.</p>

<p>December 30th broke soft and balmy, the wind blowing
from the south. At ten o'clock we heard dull
sounds upon the wind as of a distant conflict of arms.
It was not imagination. Every one heard them, and we
were all curiosity to know their meaning. Soon after,
a number of scouts arrived from Mexico with orders to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
Major Stone to hurry on to that place. They at the
same time brought reports of an engagement in that
vicinity. We moved without delay. The column kept
the railroad track till within about three miles of Mexico,
when it took a wagon road to the left. The mud was
deep, and wagons several times stalled and men had to
be detailed to lift them out. These accidents caused
temporary delays, so that we did not reach Mexico till
9 P.&nbsp;M. We found here a force under Brig. Gen. Schofield,
of the State troops. Gen. Henderson had just left
in pursuit of the enemy. Of the cause of the firing we
had heard, we could learn nothing. It might have been
a skirmish. It was more likely a detachment discharging
their pieces to get the loads out of them.</p>

<p>Our battalion was quartered in a large vacant building.
We found the inhabitants of the place intensely
disloyal. A newspaper had just been issued at the
printing office, one side of which was belabored over
with treasonable articles and extracts. This being completed,
the editor had fled on the approach of the Union
troops, leaving the typos to complete the paper, which
they did, accommodating the other side to the views of
the new comers. Their unionism was sickeningly submissive.</p>

<p>During the night and the following morning, a number
of excesses were committed by members of our regiment,
among which was breaking into a liquor shop
owned by a secessionist, and emptying seven barrels of
that delectable article into a ditch.</p>

<p>This affair being committed in the presence of a large
number of citizens, greatly and justly incensed the Major,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
who called out the battalion, had roll-call in all the
companies; when he mounted a box, and made a speech,
in which he denounced such conduct, accusing us of
having prostituted ourselves "and disgraced our State,"
and reproving us in unpleasant terms for having railed
at our surgeon for giving us too much quinine, and
at our quartermaster for giving us too little bread.
He did not fail, however, to compliment us as having
"stood before the enemy where fire and earthquake led
the charge." After sundry similar compliments, denunciations
and threats, he dismissed us, and allowed us to
go to our quarters. Whatever apparent reason there
might have been for this performance, it totally failed
in producing a good effect upon the regiment. The men
went away with the opinion that to make a boisterous
speech in the streets of a public town, and to humiliate
his men in the face of their enemies, did not become a
military chieftain. Those who had not been guilty of
any offenses felt the wrong most keenly.</p>

<p>It is true that whenever a halt had been ordered on
the march hither, our quartermaster had been assailed
with cries of "bread," our surgeon with cries of "quinine."
In this respect we were undoubtedly "demoralized."
But were these men abusing their superiors
without a cause, or were they replying to abuse? The
quartermaster furnished transportation for vinegar,
beans and two negro servants, articles which are of no
use to any army on the march, and the surgeon hauled
his own private effects in the ambulances, while men
marched in the ranks carrying heavy knapsacks and
shaking with the ague. It is better to suffer abuse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
than to be insubordinate; but men do not always
properly appreciate this doctrine; and to correct
his conduct belongs first to his officer, then to the
soldier.</p>

<p>At 4 P.&nbsp;M. General Schofield placed himself at the
head of our battalion, and we moved back in the direction
whence we had come. The troops took the railroad
track. For the first three miles our route lay through
timber, and then we reached a level stretch of prairie
ten or twelve miles wide, the rank, dry grass affording
an opportunity of setting a prairie fire, such as we had
so often seen on our own prairies of Iowa. It was a
temptation which we could not resist. Before eight
o'clock the whole vault of night was illuminated.
Lines of flame extended as far as the gaze could reach,
sending up immense columns of red smoke. The clouds
blazed like a sea of fire, and shed upon us a strange red
light, which made our march almost as plain as day.
We moved at a rapid rate, making but one or two short
halts, and these in consequence of the wagons sticking
in the mud. No one gave out; there was no straggling.
Only a few sick men got aboard the wagons. General
Schofield was surprised at the endurance of the men.
He asked Major Stone if his men generally marched as
well; and when the Major told him they did, he complimented
them highly.</p>

<p>At 10 P.&nbsp;M. we reached Martinsburg, a distance of
thirteen miles from Mexico, where we halted to pass the
remainder of the night. We got our baggage unloaded,
made our beds on the wet ground, covered ourselves
with blankets and tents and tried to sleep. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
wind shifted to the northwest, and blew so hard that all
our covering availed us little.</p>

<p>The New Year dawned with a sky overcast with
gloomy clouds and with a boisterous northwest wind.
The world without us corresponded exactly with the
world within us. All was gloom. A few New Year's
greetings were exchanged, and many fond thoughts
went back to the happy firesides we had exchanged for
the cheerless camp fires, the days of hunger and fatigue,
the weary marches and watches, and the fearful chances
of war.</p>

<p>In the middle of the day we moved five miles further
to Wellsville, where General Schofield established
his headquarters.</p>

<p>We took quarters in the vacant buildings and the
first night slept on the cold floors, as crowded as though
we had been in cattle cars on the Hannibal &amp; St. Joseph
Railroad. That night, or rather the next morning at
two o'clock, three companies of our regiment, and one
of the cavalry, went ten or twelve miles into the country
expecting to surprise a company of guerrillas, but did
not find them.</p>

<p>Our quarters were crowded and inadequate; but we
accommodated ourselves to them cheerfully. The exposures
of the past week had reduced many to the sick
list. Surgeon Edwards treated our sick outrageously.
I firmly believe that more than one good soldier died
for no other reason than his neglect. Those in his
hospital he left without food and proper nursing for
twenty-four hours at a time. He absolutely refused
to hear the complaints of twenty men reported on one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
sick list, declaring that they were malingerers, that it
was impossible for such a number to be sick. Two or
three of these men were coughing blood; others had
raging fevers.</p>

<p>It affords me especial pleasure to do this man justice.
He was one of the most learned and skillful physicians
of our State. His physical endurance, and capability
of long exertion was such as few men possess; and yet,
save when in some particular freak of good humor, he
seemed to give his attentions most grudgingly, and to
take a fiendish delight in abusing sick men of which we
can scarcely believe human nature capable. If he survives
this war it will be to receive the heartfelt execrations
of those of my comrades who survive it.</p>

<p>For some time this part of our regiment remained
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in statu quo</i> at Wellsville. The other battalion of it
still remained at Florence under Captain Herron. The
monotony of our situation at Wellsville was relieved
by bringing in from the surrounding country various
classes of persons as prisoners: sympathizers, bridge-burners,
bushwhackers, blatant traitors and members
of Price's old State Guard. Whatever excesses we may
have committed with or without excuse upon citizen
enemies, when they were in our power, we treated them
with the respect due to prisoners of war. At one time
our guard house contained upwards of twenty prisoners,
citizens and soldiers. They were disposed of in various
ways. Some were sent to St. Louis for trial. Some
were transferred to Alton. Most were released on
giving bonds to the United States.</p>

<p>For the first time since being in Missouri, we subsisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
our animals entirely upon forage taken from disloyal
citizens. For this purpose, foraging parties went out
nearly every day. Notwithstanding the stringent orders
under which their commanders were placed, they were
generally the occasion for carrying off whatever the
soldier could find that would suit his appetite better
than bacon and pilot bread. I never heard, however,
of any outrages being committed in houses, the operations
being seldom extended beyond the poultry yard,
pig sty and potato bin.</p>

<p>On the 23d of January, all of our regiment was
moved west, and distributed along the railroad at four
different places; Mexico, Allen, Sturgis and Huntsville.
Everything now went well. Our quarters, surroundings
and duties were most pleasant. We were in the
midst of civilization and social cheer. The Union had
many friends in Missouri, and they entertained us
generously. We were again seeing the halcyon days
of a soldier's life; but we did not know it. We wanted
glory. When Grant moved up the Tennessee we wanted
to be with him. Many troops went from Missouri to
reinforce him; but we were left behind. Fort Henry
was taken, and we were not there. But the land forces
had won no laurels in that operation. We hoped that
we might be sent to take part in the reduction of Fort
Donelson. But no. Train after train went past us
loaded with troops from General Hunter's department,
all going to reinforce Grant; but still we were left behind.
Curtis was moving; Grant was moving; Buell
was moving; McClellan was moving; Burnside was
moving. The army was advancing at all points, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
we were left behind, guarding railroads and keeping
down guerrillas. At length Fort Donelson fell. A
thrill of joy electrified the nation. A universal burst
of praise went up for the gallant men who there had
fought so well. General Halleck telegraphed to Governor
Kirkwood, "The 2d Iowa have proved themselves
the bravest of the brave." And yet we were doing garrison
duty in the rear. What had we done to merit less
than these comrades of ours? Had we failed our country
in the hour of trial? Had we done so little, suffered
so little, and complained so much? Since Ft. Donelson,
all the little battles of the war were forgotten. Blue
Mills had dwindled into an insignificant affair. When
we read the glowing accounts of these three days of
battle, we almost ceased to be proud of it ourselves.
A soldier would rather die than be behind in honor.
We begged for a chance. We had no fears for the rest.
At length we began to despair. We feared it was the
intention of the commanding general to keep us behind
always. We began to be ashamed of ourselves. We
were ashamed to date our letters from Missouri. We
would have blushed to look our friends in the face; for
who thought of us now?</p>

<p>Meanwhile the trial of Colonel Williams was taking
place at St. Louis. Witnesses went and came. It was
protracted from day to day. Among the enlisted men
of the regiment, the feeling was still strong and bitter
against him. Finally it was announced that he would
be released. It was without much disappointment; for
we had watched the developments of the trial, and
expected this event. At length it was reported that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
would join us, and that we should then be taken to
the front. We rejoiced.</p>

<p>On the 25th of February, Colonel Williams arrived
at regimental headquarters, Mexico, Missouri. Companies
F and K were stationed here. The latter received
him with some courtesy; the former with marked
disdain. The memories of Chariton bridge still rankled
in their bosoms. Nevertheless, we were disposed to
be hopeful. We hoped that his long arrest had furnished
an opportunity for meditation and repentance,
and that he would be more careful of his conduct now.
This was the case. Before his arrival we did every
thing slackly. We almost began to forget that we were
soldiers. The first thing he did was to enforce discipline.
He instituted regular roll-calls, drills twice a
day, and daily dress parades. He did nothing that we
could complain of, although we watched him with the
eyes of cynics. Day by day our former prejudices
against him began to wear away. Almost imperceptibly
those hitherto antagonistic elements, the colonel and his
men, began to harmonize. Colonel Williams was a wiser
officer, and we were better soldiers.</p>

<p>On the 3d of March, it was announced, amid great
rejoicing, that we would leave for the south as soon as
transportation should arrive to take us away.</p>

<p>The day of preparation for an important movement,
is always among soldiers a busy and a jolly day. It is
a day of work and play. Boxing up camp utensils,
packing knapsacks, loading wagons and cooking rations
constitutes the work. Drinking, carousing and building
bonfires constitutes the play. I need not say that those
who do the least work generally do the most play. For
this time I can only speak of the two companies at
Mexico. During the day the order was work. Every
thing passed off quietly and in order. By nightfall
everything was ready and we only waited the cars.
The troops who relieved us, a detachment of the Third
Iowa Cavalry, had already ensconced themselves in
our quarters.</p>

<p>It was now time to play. Some of my comrades had
this failing, that in an hour of great glee like this, they
would drink. There are a class of soldiers who never
drink except on such occasions. The "riotons" commenced.
Bonfires were kindled, bottles emptied, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
cries and cheers and songs and peals of laughter rent
the air. I would not wish to be compelled to swear to
all the unmilitary proceedings that I saw that night,
nor to what I think might have taken place, had Colonel
Williams been less vigilant and some of his men more
sober. The Colonel used every exertion, and with
partial success, to keep those who were disposed to be
noisy within proper bounds.</p>

<p>At 11 P.&nbsp;M., we went aboard a train of box cars, and
having disposed ourselves for sleep as best we could,
awaited the dawn of day. To our surprise the bottoms
of some of the cars were covered thickly with sawdust.
We raked it up and made our beds upon it, and many
were careful to get their full share. When we woke up
in the morning, we found that we had been sleeping
upon&mdash;well, the cars had been last used to transport
Government horses.</p>

<p>This train carried but five companies, the remaining
portion of the regiment coming upon another.</p>

<p>Morning found us at St. Charles, where we halted for
breakfast, and smoked ourselves awhile around some
ugly fires. The wind blew cold and raw from the northwest,
and made us wish ourselves again in our moving
quarters. We soon crossed the Missouri river and got
aboard a train of passenger cars which brought us to
St. Louis. After a long delay at the depot, we formed
battalion, and marched through the city with all the
pomp of which we were capable. At the levee we went
aboard the <i>Crescent City</i>, a boat which was waiting to
convey troops. One that has not seen it can scarcely
imagine the scene attendant upon a regiment of volunteers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
getting aboard a transport. The violent scrambling
for the best places; the shouts of soldiers for messmates,
and the grumbling of malcontents generally,
make up a hubbub which never can be adequately
described.</p>

<p>The remainder of the regiment arrived the next day,
and the whole was transferred to the <i>Iatan</i>. It was
not without the greatest difficulty that the officers were
able to keep the men together. A number got into the
guard-house of the provost guard; many straggled
through the city, and some officers set the example;
many became intoxicated, and before night, I am compelled
to state, the scene in the vicinity of the boat was
disgraceful in the extreme. A strong chain of sentries
had to be stationed to keep the men from straggling.</p>

<p>Colonel Williams having procured the release of those
in the guard-house and got the command aboard, the
boat moved out at 8 P.&nbsp;M. The boat was heavily loaded
with Government wagons and animals besides its human
freight, and the river being heavy with floating ice, we
moved slowly. In the morning we passed St. Genevieve
by a channel which left it four or five miles to our right.
It was a lovely sight as we viewed it in the distance, its
windows throwing back the red blaze of the rising sun.
I will say nothing of the unwearying beauty of the
scenes through which we passed this day. We arrived
at Cairo at 8 P.&nbsp;M., and consumed part of the next day
in getting coal and subsistence on board. Commodore
Foote's iron-clad fleet was lying here at this time, some
of the boats undergoing repairs.</p>

<p>At 3 P.&nbsp;M., March 9th, we moved up the Ohio. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
was swollen, sweeping over its banks, and through the
forests on the Kentucky shore. We went to sleep upon
its waters, and in the morning were steaming up the
beautiful Tennessee. We arrived at Fort Henry at ten
o'clock, and spent some time in viewing the work.
Most of the troops in this vicinity were leaving or had
left. General Grant was still here. Since arriving at
Cairo, we had had vague rumors that we were to join
an expedition which was to push up the Tennessee as
far as Florence, Alabama. We now learned that the
expedition was to be under Major General C. F. Smith,
and that our regiment was to be assigned to the division
of Brigadier General Hurlbut. This latter information
displeased us exceedingly, as we had lost all confidence
in that officer in Missouri.</p>

<p>Leaving Fort Henry, we soon came up with a large
fleet of transports loaded with troops, and at the railroad
bridge twelve miles above were a number more. This
river, like the Ohio, was very high, and swept through
the bottoms on either side. The boat did not halt for
night; but when we awoke in the morning, it was tied
up and taking on wood in the shape of a rail fence and
a pile of staves. All day we steamed up the river.
The day was bright and beautiful, and the canebrakes
and cedars along the banks had a greenness that reminded
us of spring, and a soft breeze enhanced the
pleasure of the ride. And when we saw all along the
shore the citizens greet us with demonstrations of gladness
and applause, we felt that we belonged to an army
of liberation indeed. The way was lined with boats
loaded with troops, we passing them, and they passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
us in turn. Before night, we found ourselves in a
mighty transport fleet, numbering from eighty to ninety
vessels, loaded to the water's edge with infantry, cavalry
and artillery, and crowding up the river at full steam.
Sometimes several boats would ride abreast and try
their speed in the strong current, while the applause
of thousands of voices would rend the woods. We will
live long without seeing such a sight again. A grand
army, equipped in splendor and exulting in success,
moving far into the enemy's country with the speed
of steam. A grand army of sixty thousand men,
moving upon the waters. It was a glorious sight, and
we could not tire of gazing. From it every soldier
seemed to catch a sense of the great moment of the
enterprise, and of his own dignity as an agent in it.
As the sun went down, the bands struck up martial
airs, and, in the obscurity of darkness, the scene grew
more sublime. For every boat seemed a monster, its
fierce eyes gleaming through the darkness, one of green
and one of red, its dark breath rolling up against the
sky, and the hoarse breathing of its great labor astonishing
the still woods, as it hurried on, bent on some
great purpose of justice or of vengeance. It was a
great purpose indeed!&mdash;the preservation of the Republic
whose foundation was the beginning of the "new series
of ages."</p>

<p>Was there ever such an assemblage of patriots?&mdash;so
much unity, so much courage, so much hope?</p>

<p>But when we retired to our quarters, a far different
scene presented itself. Soldiers crowded together like
hogs in a pen; breathing an atmosphere contaminated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
by the breath of hundreds of men; sleeping, sitting and
eating upon filthy decks; by day continually jostled
and crowded about; kicked, jammed and trodden upon
by night; getting by day no exercise, by night no rest;
living on raw meat and tasteless pilot bread; and in all
this many suffering from sickness;&mdash;such was our condition
on these transports.</p>

<p>With our officers, however, the case was different.
They ate at the cabin table and had good fare. They
slept in state rooms. They had the ladies' cabin to
themselves, and guards were stationed to keep the soldiers
out of it. This was just. They had a right to
what they paid for. But such a contrast of comfort and
misery looked decidedly bad, especially among men who
at home were equals, and whom mutual hardship and
peril should have made friends. To us, the soldiers, it
was a convincing proof that our officers were selfish and
cared little for us. We could not see where they had
merited so much more than we. Had they been braver
in battle, or had they exposed themselves to greater
danger? They were superior to us in rank and emoluments;
but this superiority we had conferred with our
votes. Was this sharing the hardships of war as they
had promised to do, while we were yet citizens? Moreover,
rank and emolument do not always answer the
question of merit. Allowing that they had always done
their duty in the places assigned them, had they done it
better than we? Had they been more exemplary in
morals, or more attentive to duty, or more patient
under suffering? Had they been so diligent in the
acquisition of military knowledge as to be worthy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
exemption from hardship? We could not see it. There
was nothing peculiarly hard in their duties which should
create this disparity. They did no fatigue duty. They
did not carry a gun, a cartridge-box or a knapsack on
a march. They did not have to walk the sentinel's beat
in storm. The surgeon did not abuse them when they
were sick. When they said they were not able to do
duty, they were believed. But the Government had
conferred on them these privileges. It was just. We had
no right to complain. No, it was not just, for humanity
is no more than justice; and there were men suffering
from sickness who needed these comforts more than they.
Generosity at least would have prompted them to deny
themselves some comforts for the sake of alleviating
the distress of others. It would certainly go far to prevent
demoralization in the ranks.</p>

<p>There was an officer who seemed to be actuated by
these motives. Let his name be printed in capitals,
CAPTAIN ALBERT HOBBS. He ate with his men,
and, in consequence of this, many of his brother officers
made merry of him, calling him in his absence, "Mother
Hobbs." He merited their opprobrium, simply by being
a comrade to his men. This brave and good man was
mortally wounded in the battle of Shiloh, and was buried
near the spot where he fell. His memory will always
be cherished by those who served under him.</p>

<p>Daylight of March 12th, found the great flotilla at
anchor opposite Savannah, Tennessee, a dilapidated village
about twenty-five miles from the Alabama line.</p>

<p>The citizens of Savannah were for the most part
favorable to our cause. The town was full of refugees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
from rebel conscription, to whom our presence was
really a deliverance. Their stories of sufferings under
the rebel rule would fill volumes. Their patriotism was
genuine and unfeigned. Many of them enlisted on the
gunboat Tyler, and in the 46th Ohio regiment.</p>

<p>The morning after our arrival at Savannah, we heard
cannonading above us. We could only conjecture the
cause of it then; but learned afterwards that it was the
gunboats Tyler and Lexington, which convoyed the
fleet, engaging the enemy's batteries at Eastport, Miss.
The same day most of the fleet moved up the river, and
our regiment went ashore to allow our boats to be
cleansed, and before we were allowed to go aboard
again, we enjoyed the luxury of being out in a drizzling
rain.</p>

<p>We found at Savannah another illustration of the
fact, that the farther an army gets from railroads and
telegraphs, the more news the country affords. The
citizens informed us that a battle had been fought near
Manasses, resulting disastrously to the rebels; that
though losing 10,000 men in killed and wounded, McClellan
had taken 60,000 prisoners! We also learned
that Beauregard was concentrating a hundred thousand
men a few miles above us,&mdash;a report in which there was
more truth than we were willing to believe.</p>

<p>Here, pausing and looking around us, the movements
of the enemy and the designs of our generals began, if
possible, to assume a more tangible shape in our ideas.
The army of General Albert Sidney Johnston had been
driven from its defensive line, which stretched from
Columbus to Bowling Green; and now, its right wing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
in full retreat before Buell, its left assailed by Pope, and
its center pierced by Grant ascending the Tennessee, it
was endeavoring to concentrate on a new line of defense,
that of the Memphis and Charleston Railroad, at the
strategic point of Corinth, having at that time communication
with all parts of the south, east and west,
including the force which was blockading the Mississippi
at Island No. Ten. With this purpose General Beauregard
had probably already arrived at Corinth with a
small portion of his troops, whither General Bragg was
hurrying with a division from Mobile and Pensacola;
and if we may credit a letter written about this time
from Decatur, Alabama, by General Johnston to Jeff.
Davis, the advance guard of his army had already
reached that point, while the main body was crossing
the Tennessee at Decatur,&mdash;a movement which he was
executing contrary to the advice of his staff, and in
which he had great apprehensions of being thwarted by
General Grant.</p>

<p>Nothing would have been easier than this, had our
fleet pushed on and landed the troops at a point from
which they could have disembarked and seized the
Memphis &amp; Charleston Railroad east of Corinth. We
could have then moved against Corinth, pushing Beauregard
toward the Mississippi and preventing his junction
with Johnston; or, in the event of his retreating
southward, isolating him from his troops at Island
No. Ten, as well as from a large portion of his forces
hastening from that direction. Thus it is seen how
easily a little vigor on our part would have disorganized
the plans of the rebel leaders, prevented their concentration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
on any practicable line of defense, thrown
confusion into their councils and demoralization into
their ranks, disheartened their people just as they were
called upon to furnish new levies, flanked the Mississippi
river as far as Memphis, seized the strategic point
of the West from which the armies of Grant and Buell
united could have commenced a new march of victory,
and, in one word, secured without bloodshed or hazard,
fruits which a year of suffering and carnage scarcely
sufficed to gain. These were golden hours of victory
to the army of the West. All that was necessary was
to march on. But just as we had reached the decisive
moment, when the events of a year could have been
accomplished in a week, we faltered. Just at the hour
when to wait should have been our farthest thought,
we halted.</p>

<p>The enemy had placed batteries at Eastport, Miss.,
to blockade the river and cover the movement of
General Johnston's troops over the railroad from Decatur
to Corinth. It is also probable that he had a
small land force at that point. The wooden gunboats
engaged the batteries unsuccessfully. But it can not
be claimed that they amounted to an obstacle in the
way of General Smith. They could easily have been
captured or driven off by our infantry. This Gen. Smith
did not attempt; whether it was that his orders restricted
his movements, or whether he was unequal to the occasion,
is yet to be made known.</p>

<p>Toward night, March 4th, three days' rations were
issued to our regiment with orders to divide, cook and
be ready to march at daylight. The kitchen furnaces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
of the boat were taken possession of for this purpose;
and notwithstanding the work was crowded vigorously,
but three companies could get their rations cooked
during the night.</p>

<p>At daylight the boats conveying General Hurlbut's
division moved up the river a few miles under convoy
of a gunboat, and halted opposite the bluffs of Pittsburg
Landing, which the enemy had occupied a few days before.
Nine boats tied up on the western bank and two
on the eastern, one of which was our own. We built
fires on shore and proceeded to cook the rations we had
not been able to do the previous evening. The whole
expedition was almost at a halt. Most of the fleet was
above us, probably endeavoring to effect a landing at
Hamburg, six miles above. We, the soldiers, knew
little of the whereabouts of the enemy. It was not fair
to conjecture that our generals knew much more. A
general generally knows much less of his antagonist
than those who are not generals think he ought to. A
few days before, the enemy had a force with some artillery
on Pittsburg Bluffs. A gunboat had engaged them
and driven off their artillery, but they in turn had
repulsed our infantry which landed and attempted to
pursue.</p>

<p>Who knew now that the enemy was not in force beyond
our observation ready to dispute our landing?
The honor of first setting foot on this historic soil
belongs to the fourth division. To land at all in the
face of the intervening bottom overflowed with water,
presented no ordinary difficulties. The 41st Illinois
regiment disembarked in light order, ascended the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
bluff and advanced into the woods to cover the movement.
General Sherman at the same time began preparations
to debark. Roads were cut up the sides of
the bluffs on which the wagons and artillery could
ascend. These dispositions being made, General Hurlbut
announced the details of the disembarking of his
division in the following order:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right break-before">
<span class="smcap">Head Quarters</span>, <span class="smcap">Fourth Division</span>, }<br />
March 17, 1862. }<br />
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">General Orders</span>,<br />
<span class="in2"><span class="smcap">No.</span> 4.</span><br />
</p>

<p>The 1st and 3d Brigades of this Division, now at
Pittsburg Landing, will disembark as rapidly as possible
and form camps by brigades, the 1st Brigade with
the left resting on the road, and the 3d with the right.
In order to establish the lines without confusion, the 1st
Brigade will commence the movement forming in brigade
line right in front on the road. On reaching the point
designated by a staff officer detailed for that purpose,
the brigade will file right into line perpendicular to the
road. Regiments taking positions according to the
rank of their Colonels, from right to left. The 3d
Brigade will be formed on the same road, left in front,
and on reaching their line will file left into brigade line
on the extension of the line of the 1st Brigade. Full
room to the front will be taken by these brigades so as to
permit the other troops to establish camps in their rear.</p>

<p>Tents will be pitched by the single file by the companies.
After the above line is established, the brigades
will stack arms and break by right of companies for the
1st Brigade, and by left of companies for the 3d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
Brigade to the rear, leaving an interval of twenty-five
paces from the color line to the first company tent.</p>

<p>Proper details will then be made to bring up the
baggage and trains of the Regiments, and have but the
details allowed to leave the regimental grounds. The
transportation of each brigade will be used for this purpose
without reference to the Regiments under the orders
of the Brigade Quarter Master.</p>

<p>Thirty paces will be allowed between regiments, unless
the nature of the ground compels a wider interval.
Police and Regimental guards will be established before
the Brigades stack arms. Commanding officers will see
that sinks are established for their officers and men at
once.</p>

<p>Burrow's Battery will occupy ground between the
two Brigades, one-half with the 1st, and the other with
the 3d. Mann's Battery, on the <i>Key West</i> will drop
over to this side of the river as soon as the landing is
opened, and be assigned to cover the flank of the 3d
Brigade.</p>

<p>As fast as a boat is cleared of troops and baggage, it
will be reported to these Head Quarters and sent to
Savannah. The orders are to hold Pittsburg Landing
and the honorable post of exterior line in front is given
to this Division.</p>

<p>All officers are enjoined to give their strict personal
attention to discipline and drill in their respective commands.
Their attention is especially called to the 49th
and 50th Articles of War, and they are notified that
they will be strictly enforced. Each Regiment will clear
its regimental ground for parade and drill, and as soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
as possible a rigid inspection will be made by Brigade
commanders.</p>

<p>The 3d Iowa will establish camp perpendicularly to
the line of the 1st Brigade, the right toward the river
along the brush. The <i>Empress</i> and <i>Emerald</i>, having
commissary stores on board, will fix themselves at some
convenient points as soon as the rest of the transportation
is drawn off. The General commanding will take
Head-Quarters on shore as soon as the line is established.</p>

</p></blockquote>

<p>While the work preparatory to disembarking was
going on, the men were allowed to go ashore to cook
their rations and wash their clothes. Much curiosity
was exhibited in examining the field of the recent engagement.
The bodies left on the field had been but
slightly buried by the enemy, and the graves were covered
over with rails. While an Illinois regiment was
exhuming and reburying the bodies of their fallen comrades,
many soldiers crowded around to get a view of
the marred faces of the dead. And so great was the
curiosity of some young soldiers to see the bodies of
men who had been slain in battle, that a guard had to
be placed over the graves of the enemy's dead to prevent
them from being again torn open.</p>

<p>The Fourth Division landed on the 17th, agreeably
to General Hurlbut's order, and the 3d Iowa took position
on the bluff in rear of the line. We drew new
Sibley tents, and six were allowed to the company.
The ground was full of water; but our quarters were
commodious and contrasted delightfully with the filthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
decks of the Iatan. But sickness was already becoming
alarmingly prevalent among us. The confinement, bad
diet, and bad air to which we had been subject, had
thinned our ranks and filled the hospital as much as a
hard fought battle. The water which we now had to
drink was brackish and sickening. It was furnished by
surface springs, and was the soakings of the roots of all
the vegetation of the forest. Camp diarrh&oelig;a was the
prevailing malady. We had not been in camp a week
before there was scarcely a man who did not have it.</p>

<p>The Third Iowa was assigned by direction of Major
General Grant, to the 1st Brigade, Fourth Division, and
Col. Williams, as ranking officer, assumed command.
The Brigade was composed of the Third Iowa, the 32d
Illinois, Col. John Logan, the 41st Illinois, Col. I. C.
Pugh, the 28th Illinois, Col. E. K. Johnson, and Burrow's
Battery of light guns. It was very fortunate for
Col. Williams to be thus placed in command of a brigade
of such excellent troops, and his friends are confident
that if he had not been disabled early in the battle of
Shiloh, he would have silenced the accusations against
him. Major Stone was left in command of our regiment,
Col. Scott being absent on account of sickness.
We twice changed our camp previous to the battle, and
when that event occurred, the 1st Brigade was camped
in proper order, the 3d Iowa on the extreme right. Beyond
us were the divisions of Sherman and Prentiss, and
to our right those of McClernand and Smith.</p>

<p>In the confusion of hills, ravines, and cross-roads, it
was scarcely possible for a casual observer to come to a
definite conclusion as to the topography of our camps.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
But he did not have to look twice at that city of white
tents in the solemn forest to be impressed with the grandeur
of the sight. As far as the eye could reach the
hills were covered with them. By day the roads were
choked with baggage wagons coming and going; the
woods teemed with armed men; the air was full of martial
sounds. The noise of artillery firing on drill with
blank cartridges, joined to that of soldiers discharging
their pieces in the woods, at times almost counterfeited
a battle. The field music, bugles and bands were continually
playing, and a steam calliope on one of the
transports seemed to catch up their notes and repeat
them to the distant hills.</p>

<p>Our spare tent was mostly occupied with drills and
reviews. The weather was much of the time rainy,
and sickness and despondency continued to increase.
We had tidings that our arms were everywhere successful,
and yet we were in gloom. It almost seemed to us
that we were suffering to no purpose. In a week or ten
days after our arrival at Pittsburg Landing, the roads
had dried up so as to be quite passable. Why, then,
did we not advance? The reason is obvious now. Our
delay had given the enemy time to concentrate at Corinth,
and we must now wait the arrival of Buell before
resuming the offensive. Ah! how nearly fatal was the
delay! Our blunder in failing to deal the enemy a
a decisive blow when we had the opportunity is equaled
by that of allowing him the opportunity of dealing a
decisive blow against us. He was concentrating a large
army within a few days' march of us, with what design
we were ignorant, whether merely to arrest our further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
advance, or to march upon us and give us battle. In
the latter event our situation was a highly dangerous
one. With an impassable river immediately in our
rear, and an impenetrable forest on either flank, defeat
would amount to no less than destruction and capture.
The soldiers themselves were not so stupid as not to
discern the peril to which we were exposed. Nevertheless,
not even the ordinary precautions were taken
against it. The troops were not camped in proper line
of battle; reconnoissances were unfrequent and unsatisfactory;
picketing at the time of the attack was done
only by the infantry; and the picket line was but a
short distance in front of the line of advanced camps;
and what was well nigh as bad, the headquarters of the
commanding general were at Savannah, eight miles
away. We had rumors that the enemy were evacuating
Corinth, and again that he was marching against us.
Whatever we believed, we could not deny that if the
enemy expected to give us a decisive blow, he would
attempt it now. The evening before the battle, I observed
a captain talking with one of his men as they
viewed from an eminence near the Landing the camps
of the army. Their observations on the danger of our
situation were very similar to those I have just made.
Their words were almost prophetic. For in twenty-four
hours that army whose camps they saw extending
so widely and so beautifully, was rolled back a broken
mass upon the bluff, half of its artillery and most of
its material in the hands of the enemy, and with two
hours more of such disaster, would have been utterly
destroyed or captured.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 4th of April, while a heavy
thunderstorm was raging, we heard dull sounds in advance
like the firing of infantry. It was the 5th Ohio
Cavalry encountering a reconnoitering force of the
enemy. These sounds created little alarm until, when
both they and the storm had ceased, the long-roll began
to beat in the different camps. But for some reason
the drums of the Third Iowa were silent, until General
Hurlbut rode through our camp and impatiently ordered
them to beat. When the long-roll had ceased beating,
there arose a noise throughout the camps which sounded
more like the ghost of a battle than any thing to which
it can be likened. It was the men bursting caps to
clear out the tubes of their guns. General Hurlbut
hurried his troops forward to the support of Sherman.
The regiments joined one after another in the column
as they took the road. The mud was deep, the artillery
wheels sinking nearly to the hubs, and what made it
worse, it was already getting quite dark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>When we had advanced about three-quarters of a
mile, General Hurlbut received orders to turn back.
This put the boys in great glee; for we did not at all
relish the idea of sleeping in the mud without blankets,
and we had no expectation of a fight. The dullest soldier
now found occasion to explode a little wit, and
numerous and loud were the jokes and retorts that
passed from mouth to mouth, as the column straggled
through the deep mud. The general himself did not
escape being holloaed at ever and anon by some graceless
wag. We went to sleep that night without any
apprehensions in consequence of the alarm, although we
had heard General Hurlbut say that the enemy was
either evacuating Corinth or moving against us; and
that this cavalry movement was either a feint to deceive
us, or a reconnoissance to discover our position.</p>

<p>The following day, all was quiet throughout the
camps. No one seemed to think of such a thing as the
immediate presence of the enemy. Several boats
arrived loaded with troops, among which were the 16th
Iowa, 18th Wisconsin, and Madison's battery of siege
guns. Madison's men had been with us in Missouri,
and we greeted them almost as friends. These two
infantry regiments were undrilled and had just received
their arms. They were sent forward to Prentiss in the
advance.</p>

<p>There were rumors among us that Buell had arrived
at Savannah; but no one seemed to feel certain that it
was so. From the front there were no tidings of any
thing unusual&mdash;not an intimation of the nearness of the
enemy. Over all was settled a frightful calm. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
that which indicates the gathering storm. Within an
hour's march of us the enemy was taking his positions
for battle. What a whirlwind was preparing for the
morrow!</p>

<p>We have reached a day when history pauses and
hesitates. It began in astonishment and cloud and
mystery. It developed into a tempest. It ended in
disaster and wreck. Officers and men alike it blinded.
It is doubtful whether the commanding general, once
on the field, succeeded in comprehending it. The soldier
that fights in a battle neither sees, hears nor understands
it. It is a confusion, an infinitude of noises, an
earthquake of jarring multitudes. A man plunges into
it, and the fountains of his emotions are broken up.
He endeavors to hear and see and realize all that is
taking place around him; but his faculties recoil exhausted.
The situation masters him. He yields himself
to it, and sees himself drifted on like a grain of sand
in a tornado. A thousand sights and sounds and
emotions rush upon him; but he does not comprehend
them. Nevertheless there are certain bold outlines that
imprint themselves on his memory. When the storm
is over, he closes his eyes and senses to see again this
indistinguishable spectral train of terrible images. All
reappear before him,&mdash;lines of battle advancing and
retreating, infantry rushing, and batteries galloping to
and fro;&mdash;over all, the smoke of battle, as if endeavoring
to shut out the gaze of Heaven, and amid all a
deafening crash of sounds, as if it were feared some
higher voice than man's would be heard forbidding.</p>

<p>But there are times in battle when the chaotic whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
resolves itself into definite shapes, some of which we see
clearly. What we see of the great tempest at these
times, together with the myriad rushing shapes of which
we form no definite conception, form our recollections
of a great battle. He alone who views it at a distance
can be its historian. Those who participate in it can
only contribute items.</p>

<p>With us the battle of Shiloh was not a battle. It
was merely a resistance&mdash;a planless, stubborn resistance.
After the first onset of the enemy, which was to
the whole army, if not to General Grant himself, a
complete surprise, the field was contested by our troops
with a heroism which will forever redound to their
honor. Divisions, brigades, regiments, men, fought
recklessly, but no one could tell how; such was the
tumult without and within. Such was the obscurity we
can scarcely affirm with certainty what we believe we
saw. Facts confronted each other and became uncertainties;
certainties contradicted each other; impossibilities
became certainties. This is why history
hesitates.</p>

<p>I do not undertake a general description of the battle
of Shiloh. I can only tell how the part of the conflict
I saw appeared to me; how my regiment went through
it; what it did and what it attempted to do. Beyond
this, I can only sum up the general phases. Surprised
at seven, and our front line broken; reinforced and
confident at ten; stubborn at twelve; desperate at two;
our lines crumbling away at three; broken at four;
routed and pulverized at five; at six, rallying for a
last desperate stand; at which time a third army<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
appears on the field and a new battle properly commences.</p>

<p>At about an hour of sun, while we were eating our
breakfasts, vollies of musketry were heard in advance.
We remarked, "they are skirmishing pretty sharply in
front." By degrees the firing grew steadier and nearer.
"If," said we, "it is a reconnoissance of the enemy, it
is a bold one; for he is certainly pushing back our
advanced troops." Suddenly set in the noise of cannon&mdash;jar
after jar&mdash;quicker and quicker, announcing
too truly that the enemy was attacking us in force.
Many instinctively buckled on their accoutrements and
took their guns. Others continued to manifest the
utmost indifference, and some laughed at the vollies
which announced the slaughter of comrades. These
manifestations were counterfeits. They lied about the
real feelings within. A man may put on the outward
appearance of indifference or mirth; but when fortune
begins to play freaks with all he has or hopes for, he is
seldom mirthful, never indifferent.</p>

<p>And now the long roll began to beat. The soldiers
flew to their arms and canteens, the officers to their
swords and men, the wagoners to their mules and
wagons, the surgeons to their tools and ambulances,
the sutlers to their books and goods. Our regiment
was promptly formed and moved to the front and left.
Passing the 32d Illinois in line, we heard a field officer
tell them that any one guilty of straggling from the
ranks should be court-martialed for cowardice and
shot. They cheered the announcement, and our voices
loudly responded. Meanwhile stragglers in wagons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
with wounded men, and in squads with and without
arms, began to pour down the road. To our questions
they answered that they had fought an hour without
support(!); that the enemy was in their camps; that
their regiments were all cut to pieces; to all of which
ridiculous stories we paid no attention, but passed on.
About a mile in advance the battle was now raging
with fury. Our regiment moved by the flank, taking
direction to the southwest and diverging to the left from
the main road on which we had marched the previous
Friday evening. We moved in this way through tangled
woods for perhaps half a mile, when we filed to the right
and shifted by the left flank into line, in which manner
we advanced perhaps a quarter of a mile. Among so
many obstacles of logs, trees and underbrush, it was
impossible to move in line with any degree of steadiness.
Our line wavered, sometimes opening into great
gaps, and sometimes closing so as to crowd the men
together into several ranks, if indeed it can be said that
we maintained any ranks at all. Before leaving our
camp we had been ordered to load. As soon as we
began to advance in line we were ordered to fix bayonets.
This increased our confusion, because it increased our
expectations, and because it was much more difficult to
march through the thick brush with bayonets fixed.
At the same time, whose fault it was I do not know, we
did not have a skirmisher between us and the enemy.</p>

<p>We had not marched far this way before we met
scattered stragglers pouring through the woods. We
at length halted, dressed our line, and other regiments
of the 1st Brigade formed on our left. At this time a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
mass of stragglers hurried pell mell past our right,
whom a field officer was trying to rally. It proved to
be what was left of a regiment of Sherman's division,
led, or rather followed, by a lieutenant colonel. By
mingled entreaties and threats he succeeded in inducing
a few of them to form and close up the interval between
our regiment and the one on our left. A sergeant of
one of our companies took occasion to speak depreciatingly
of their courage; but Major Stone rebuked him,
telling him it was no time for crimination now. The
Major evidently believed as did most of his men, that
the situation was a precarious one, and that we, too,
might be likewise routed.</p>

<p>It is a literal fact that some of the regiments of Sherman's
and Prentiss' divisions were pulverized by the
first onset of the enemy. They fled through the woods
in panic, like sheep pursued by wolves. Neither commands,
threats nor entreaties were of any avail to check
them. They could hear behind them the enemy's musketry
and his shout of triumph; but they could not see
before them, the revolvers presented to their breasts by
their officers, who demanded of them to turn back and
face the enemy. Idle waste of words! Honor, glory,
country, liberty; defeat, captivity, humiliation, shame;&mdash;all
were alike to them. You shouted these words to
them, but they did not understand you. It was no time
for them to think of such things now. They had but
one thought, to save themselves from the enemy's balls
and bayonets. Of all their hearts cherished, nothing
was so dear to them as their worthless carcasses. You
shouted "coward!" "dastard!" in their ears. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
admitted it and rushed on. They had no colonels, no
captains, no country; no firesides, no honor, no future.
What was more discouraging than all, officers were sometimes
seen to lead in these shameless stampedes.</p>

<p>At this very time regiments and battalions were
hurrying forward to reinforce them and close up the
breaches caused by their ignoble flight. We could look
back and see them coming. It was a glorious, an all-cheering
sight, battalion after battalion moving on in
splendid order, stemming the tide of these broken
masses; not a man straggling; regiments seeming to
be animated by one soul. These were the troops of the
Fourth Division, and this was the splendid manner in
which their general led them against the enemy.</p>

<p>While in this position, where the First Brigade formed
its first line at half past eight in the morning, the enemy
advanced his batteries and began to shell us vigorously.
Before us was a gentle ridge covered with dense woods
and brush. The enemy fired at random. We lay flat
on the ground and laughed at his shells exploding harmlessly
in the tops of the trees above us. Our regiment
shifted position two or three times here; but the whole
brigade was soon ordered forward to take a position in
a cotton field where one of our batteries had been
planted. Beyond this field, we for the first time caught
sight of the enemy, his regiments with their red banners
flashing in the morning sun marching proudly and all
undisturbed through the abandoned camps of Prentiss.
To him as suddenly appeared the 1st Brigade, widely
deployed upon the open field, the ground sloping toward
him and not a brush to conceal us from his view; a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
single blue line, compact and firm, crowned with a
hedge of sparkling bayonets, our flags and banners
flapping in the breeze; and in our center a battery of
six guns, whose dark mouths scowled defiance at him.
The enemy's infantry fronted toward us and stood.
Ours kneeled and brought their pieces to the ready.
Thus for some moments the antagonists surveyed each
other. He was on the offensive; we on the defensive.
We challenged him to the assault; but he moved not.
He was partly masked in the woods and the smoothbore
muskets of our regiment could not reach him. But a
regiment on the left of the brigade opened fire. The
others followed, and the fire was caught up and carried
along the entire line. It was some moments before our
officers could make the men desist from the useless waste
of powder. The enemy's infantry did not reply; but
no sooner had our foolish firing ceased than one of his
batteries, completely masked, opened upon ours with
canister. His first shots took effect. Ours replied a
few times, when its officers and men disgracefully fled,
leaving two guns in battery on the field.</p>

<p>Having driven off this battery, the enemy turned his
guns upon the infantry. But most of his discharges
flew over our heads and rattled harmlessly through the
tops of the dry trees. He soon, however, obtained our
range more perfectly, and we began to suffer from his
fire. We were thus a target for his artillery, and could
not at that range give him an effective return. Major
Stone protested against his men being kept in a position
where they were so uselessly exposed; and soon
after the brigade abandoned the field, our regiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
taking position to the right of it in front of the 17th
Kentucky.</p>

<p>The other regiments formed in rear of the field. We
were soon after moved to the rear and placed in position
in the third reserve line. In this position we were more
exposed to the enemy's artillery, his shells passing over
the advance lines and bursting frequently over our
heads, but generally far in our rear. Soon it was
rumored down the ranks that Colonel Williams was
wounded. A solid shot had passed through his horse
in rear of his saddle, killing the animal and stunning
the Colonel so badly that he had to be taken to the
rear. Colonel Pugh, of the 41st Illinois, announced
that he assumed command of the brigade.</p>

<p>Meantime the battle rose with great fury to our right.
The firing grew into a deafening and incessant roar.
For an hour we lay in this position, listening to the
exploding shells around us; to the noises of battle to
our right, and to reports that came in from different
parts of the field. The day now seemed to be everywhere
going well. It was ten o'clock. The battle had
raged for three hours. But on the left of the army the
enemy was making no serious attempts; the center,
though furiously assailed, held its ground; and it was
reported that on the right we were driving the enemy.</p>

<p>About this time General Grant, with two or three
staff officers, rode up from the rear. We were about to
raise a shout, but our officers ordered us to be silent.
An Illinois regiment in front of us cheered lustily as he
passed. The General's countenance wore an anxious
look, yet bore no evidence of excitement or trepidation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
He rode leisurely forward to the front line. We did not
see him again till night, and then he was on the bluffs
near the river endeavoring to rally his dispirited troops,
and General Buell was with him.</p>

<p>About 11 o'clock, our regiment moved so far to the
left that our left wing rested behind the cotton field.
Looking forward we could see the two abandoned pieces.
Side by side, like faithful comrades, they faced the foe,
as if ashamed to fly like the ignoble men who had left
them to their fate. But why were those guns left thus?
We had remained on the field some time after they were
abandoned, and had suffered little loss. After we had
abandoned the field, volunteers had gone forward and
spiked them. Why then could they not have been
brought away? To see our cannon abandoned when
the enemy could not come and take them away, was discouraging
enough. It was an enigma which we did not
wish to solve. Beyond the field we could now see the
enemy distinctly, and some of the time his movements
were plain to us. But he was beyond our range, and
our officers would not allow us to fire. This was an
excellent position for artillery, the open field affording
free range and a fair view of the enemy to the right and
left as well as to the front. Our duty was now to support
the several batteries which were successively ordered
to take position here, and which were successively either
ordered away or disabled by the superior practice of the
enemy. His artillery kept up a most vigorous fire.
The air was full of his screeching missiles, and his shells
burst over our heads continually. His canister reached
us spent and only capable of afflicting with bruises; his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
ordinary shells did little mischief; his case shot had the
most effect. But rapid as was his firing, when lying down,
we suffered comparatively little.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the battle commenced furiously immediately
to the right of the field and in front of the position
from which we had just moved. A fierce yell of the
enemy mingled with the increasing din of musketry
announced the approach of his assailing columns. And
now, as though a thousand angry thunders were joining
their voices, the incessant jar grated horribly upon the
ear, drowning all other sounds. The discharge of our
artillery could scarcely be heard. Dense clouds of
smoke lifted themselves above the combatants. We
listened breathless with expectation. Suddenly the
firing ceased, and a wild shout of triumph caught up by
listening comrades, borne far along the line, announced
that the assault had been repulsed. And now in the
storm a few moments lull, and the assault was renewed
with the same fury as before and with the same result.
And thus, after battering those lines for two hours with
his artillery, the enemy assailed them for three hours
with his infantry, his attacking columns withering away
each time before the well-directed fire of our heroic
troops. Nowhere on all the field of battle did the storm
rage so fiercely. Nowhere did the enemy assail and
renew the assault with such rage, and nowhere did our
troops fight with such inspiring valor. Nor was there
a place on the field which after the battle showed so
many marks of conflict. At one point, where the underbrush
was heavy, it was for several rods around literally
mowed down with rifle balls. Saplings no larger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
than a man's wrist were struck as many as seven times.
The range of the balls seems to have been perfect, few
striking lower than two, or higher than five feet from
the ground. When it is known that this storm must
have showered through the ranks of living multitudes,
was anything more needed to account for the immense
number of dead that strewed this part of the field. The
troops that held this part of our line were the 3d Brigade
of the Fourth Division, commanded by Gen. Lauman.</p>

<p>Thus we lay behind this open field silent spectators
of the battle. Mann's Missouri battery was in position
on the left of our regiment, and fired with great rapidity
and effect. General Hurlbut twice rode up and complimented
them, and his words moved the gallant Dutchmen
to tears. At times during the conflict around us
we could hear its noise on the more distant parts of the
field. As far as we could hear beyond the 3d Brigade
to our right, the firing grew more and more irregular,
and farther and farther to the rear, which told us too
well that our right and center were being crowded back.
Men that came from our regimental camp reported that
most of the forenoon the enemy's shells had been falling
there, and that now, at noon, his infantry was very near.
The 2d Brigade of the 4th Division which had been sent
early in the morning to support Sherman near the
center had been broken by overwhelming numbers and
driven from its positions with great loss. Everywhere,
except on the left, our line had crumbled before the
enemy. Now, let it be said to the honor of the 4th
Division, he had found his Farm of Hougomont. The
1st and 3d Brigades of Hurlbut and the 2d Brigade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
of Sherman, commanded by Colonel Dave Stuart, had
held this position unshaken since morning, and the
enemy's assaults had only served to multiply his dead.</p>

<p>At length he lost his reason in his baffled rage; and
failing in his repeated efforts to break the 3d Brigade,
and thus propagate on our left the disorder of the
center, he undertook to carry the cotton field and capture
the annoying battalions behind it by direct assault.
A brigade leaped the fence, line after line, and formed
on the opposite side of the field. It was a splendid
sight, those men in the face of death closing and dressing
their ranks, hedges of bayonets gleaming above
them, and their proud banners waving in the breeze;
our guns, shotted with canister, made great gaps in
their ranks, which rapidly closed, not a man faltering
in his place. And now their field officers waved their
hats. A shout arose, and that column, splendidly
aligned, took the double quick and moved on magnificently.
We could not repress exclamations of admiration.
There is a grandeur in heroism, even when connected
with a bad cause. We could not hate those men.
Were they committing a crime? They had been educated
to love what we hated. They could not advance
so splendidly upon death itself, and imagine it was for
aught but a noble cause. Nevertheless, it seemed to
us like the wrong assaulting the right&mdash;like the night
advancing upon the day; dark and gloomy, it is true,
but with all the majesty of night. We saw the truth;
we pitied the event, but recognized the inexorable necessity
of firing upon those men. Our officers ordered us
to reserve our fire and wait for the word. On, on came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
their unwavering line. Not a man faltered; not a gun
they fired. Not a gap occurred, save where our canister
went plunging through, and these were speedily closed.
Suddenly a few rifles were heard in the 32d Illinois on
our left, and a field officer was seen to fall. And then
all along our regimental line a crash of muskets maintained
in a steady roar, followed by a cloud of blinding
smoke, through which we could see nothing. We knew
not whether they stood or fell, halted, retreated, or advanced.
We only knew that their bullets at times
rattled through the fence, and that some of our men
were shot. We continued to load and fire until our
officers ordered us to cease firing, and then it was not
without much difficulty that they could make us understand
and obey them. When the smoke cleared away,
we saw what was left of this splendid brigade, retreating
in good order by the right flank, by which movement
they placed a hill between them and us. Singular
enough, many muskets again commenced firing. The
enemy's dead and wounded lay so thickly upon the field
where his charge was first checked, that they looked
like a line of troops lying down to receive our fire. It
was some time before we could believe that such was
not the case. When we saw our victory, there went up
an exultant shout. It was a moment of ineffable joy to
us. No one who has not felt it knows how a soldier
feels in such a moment of triumph. We had served ten
months, and marched and watched and fought, and suffered,
and this was our first victory. But that single
moment was sufficient to compensate us for all we had
endured to gain it.</p>

<p>Our triumph was but the beginning of disaster.
From our position we could see the enemy preparing a
storm which was to sweep us from the field. Regiment
after regiment of his infantry filed along our front
beyond the field, and took position in front of Colonel
Stuart's brigade, which formed the extreme left of the
line. Once or twice his cavalry formed as if to charge
us, and then disappeared. This was probably an attempt
to mask the movements of his other troops. It did not
succeed. We watched with harrowing expectations this
masking of his battalions on our left. We noticed, too,
that toward the right the firing had grown feeble and
irregular. This told us that the enemy was withdrawing
troops from the right and concentrating them against
this part of the line, which was all that remained unbroken.
In the meantime would we be reinforced?
We could hardly expect it; for we knew that our other
troops were broken and that there were no reserves.
Turning to ourselves we saw that we had already suffered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
heavily. Our remaining guns were well nigh
disabled, and much of our infantry was <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors de combat</i>.
And yet we saw that our only resource was our own
strength and courage. Everything seemed now at stake
and depending upon us,&mdash;life, honor, the salvation of
the army and perhaps the success of our cause. We
looked the crisis in the face, and every soldier seemed
to resolve to meet it like a man. Most of the 1st Brigade
had been moved to the left to support the expected
point of attack. General Hurlbut was there to command
the men in person, and to inspire them by his brave
example as he had already done. Half of our regiment
was moved to the left, but was not taken beyond the
end of the field.</p>

<p>At half past three o'clock, the enemy's infantry in a
column of several lines moved to the attack. From our
position we could see the immense mass sweeping
through the half open woods. The spectacle charmed
even the dread it occasioned. At the same time his
artillery, strengthened by the arrival of additional batteries,
began to fire with greatly increased vigor, and
his infantry renewed the battle on the right of the field.
Everywhere around us the storm began to rage; shot,
shell, grape, canister came howling and whistling through
our lines. The very trees seemed to protest against it.
Missiles flew everywhere. Lying on our faces we could
not escape them. Our artillery, the 2d Michigan battery,
replied feebly but bravely. Their horses were shot
down and their men swept from their guns. We could
not but admire the heroic conduct of these men, and
shudder to see them fall. When we saw them go down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
before those terrible vollies, horses, riders and gunners
thrown upon each other, we forgot all feelings but pity,
thick as was the danger around us. Their battery was
finally disabled and compelled to withdraw into the
woods. It is impossible to depict this hour of conflict.
All the noises of battle commingled rose in a bewildering
roar, and above all we could hear the cries of the
combatants as they joined, and the shouts of multitudes,
announcing a successful or an unsuccessful charge; for
we knew not whether these voices were of friends or
foes. It was a swift, anxious hour.</p>

<p>By four o'clock, the left was flanked and turned.
Regiment after regiment was successively broken from
extreme left to right. An enfilading battery opened
upon us with canister. Their cartridges exhausted in
opposing the flanking fire, and mowed down by the
enfilading canister, our troops began to retreat in disorder
through the woods. General Hurlbut rode up to
Major Stone, and said in a calm, low tone, "I look to
the 3d Iowa to retrieve the fortunes of this field."
Those who heard those memorable words will never forget
how the general looked then&mdash;a calm example of
heroism amid those thickening disasters. It was an
occasion which called forth the highest qualities of our
natures, and told us who were men. Before us the
enemy's dead strewed thickly over the field, showed us
what discipline and courage could do. Above us the
hissing and screaming of missiles; around us the roar
of battle rising louder and louder; assailed in front and
flank; the enemy to the left crowding our fugitive troops
and pressing furiously on our rear; the troops to our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
right swept back; we beheld ourselves the left and the
front of the army&mdash;all of those five divisions that remained
unshaken; and we had heard the words of the
General committing the fortunes of the day to us. I
would not write boastingly of my own regiment, nor in
the least disparage the conduct of the gallant men who
had fought on other parts of the field. That we still held
this position was owing not more to the fact that it had
proven unassailable to the enemy's infantry, than to
the heroic conduct of the troops who had fought immediately
on our right and left. I do not on this account
claim for my comrades a degree of courage which others
did not possess. I merely state the fact, and challenge
the successful contradiction of those who have claimed
the same honor for other regiments, that the 3d Iowa
was the last regiment of the front line to retreat from
the position it first occupied.</p>

<p>Such was the situation around us at half past four in
the afternoon. Major Stone resolved not to disappoint
the General, but to hold the position at whatever hazard.
Our line was withdrawn for better protection a few rods
from the fence. A part of the 2d Michigan Battery,
commanded by the gallant Lieutenant &mdash;&mdash;, was yet
with us. We were assailed by a concentrated fire of
artillery,&mdash;a direct fire from the front, a cross fire from
the right, and an enfilading fire from the left. General
Hurlbut again rode up, explained to Major Stone the
situation, that his right was driven back and his left
broken, that it was the enemy's fault that our regiment
was not captured, and ordered the Major to take us to
the rear. We moved back about three hundred yards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
and again faced toward the enemy. Here we came in
contact with the enemy's infantry, pressing confusedly
on after the fugitive troops behind our left. We availed
ourselves of every shelter the ground afforded without
breaking our line, and engaged him at close range. We
were yet almost equal to a fresh regiment. He had not
expected to meet such resistance. The buckshot from
our smoothbore muskets flew too thickly for him, and
he recoiled in astonishment. For a few moments the
field was clear. Looking forward to our old position,
we beheld the enemy's hated flag floating above the
house behind which we had rested most of the day.
Meanwhile we replenished our cartridge-boxes with
ammunition, which had been previously brought up from
the rear.</p>

<p>The enemy again advanced upon us. This regiment
was the 22d Alabama. We received it as we had done
the others, at close range. They raised their demoniac
yell and pressed on at a charging step. They came so
near that our officers used their revolvers against them.
But like the others, they recoiled and retreated before
our thick fire, leaving us masters of the ground. The
enemy subsequently acknowledged that our range was
here most perfect, and that this regiment was well nigh
destroyed in this attempt, and did not again participate
in the action either day.</p>

<p>But masses of troops now crowding past our right,
forced us to another retreat. We fell back about three
hundred yards and again faced toward the enemy, and
re-formed our line. Major Stone, in the absence of
senior officers, had been for some time gallantly fighting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
his own battle. General Prentiss was now to our right
with five regiments of Smith's division, endeavoring to
hold the enemy in check. He rode up to the Major and
explained to him what he was trying to do&mdash;to hold the
enemy in check, if possible, till the army could again
form in the rear, or till night should put an end to the
battle. He asked the Major to assist him, and that our
regiment should become his left. The Major readily
assented, and agreed to obey his orders.</p>

<p>Here, then, if the spectacle of the field was appalling,
it was sublime. Six regiments disputing the field with
the enemy's army, and delaying his expected triumph.
He crowded furiously on, assailing us in front and
flank, his soldiers howling with mingled exultation and
rage, their voices rising even above the din of battle.
He no longer came in lines nor in columns, but in confused
masses, broken in pursuit as our army had been
in retreat. His missiles swept the field in all directions.
Our dead fell thickly. Our wounded streamed
to the rear. We no longer had lines of battle, but fought
in squads and clusters. The settling smoke obscured
the vision. Comrades knew not who stood or fell. All
was confusion and chaos around us.</p>

<p>A mass of the enemy broke the regiment on our right
and separated us from Prentiss. We were again compelled
to retreat. We fell back in disorder, keeping up
a brisk fire upon the enemy, who pressed on. The Major
before ordering the retreat had determined to make
another stand in front of our regimental camp, and
make his command a nucleus on which the broken
troops of Prentiss might rally. Reaching this position,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
he sent Adjutant Sessions to form the left, while he in
person undertook to form the right. The right was
partially sheltered by a hollow; the left was on high
ground and completely exposed. From the latter point
we for the moment discerned the battle around us. To
our right and rear as far as the eye could reach,
through the woods and over the fields&mdash;at least a mile,
our line of battle in full retreat,&mdash;infantry, artillery,
wagons, ambulances, all rushing to the rear&mdash;a scene
of confusion and dismay&mdash;an army degenerating into a
rout. In front of us, partly obscured in smoke, the
enemy's assailing infantry, while to our left and rear
his multitudes were pouring through the camp of the
41st Illinois, and hurrying to cut off our retreat. In a
few moments he would be full in our rear. It was no
time to hesitate now. We must run the gauntlet he
had prepared for us or be captured. We preferred to
take the chances and run. The left wing gave way and
ran in disorder through our camp. Passing through it,
we saw to our late left, masses of the enemy very near,
firing rapidly and rushing towards us with frantic yells.
On the other side, led by a regiment well aligned, he
was directing himself so as to cut off our retreat.
Between these two fires we were completely exposed
and suffered our greatest loss. At no time had we been
exposed to so thick a fire. More of our men fell within
the lines of our own regimental camp than anywhere
else upon the field. Major Stone, retreating last with
the right wing, crossed the open space between our camp
and drill ground, and coming again into the woods, ran
full against a rebel regiment, and with a few men was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
captured. With the exception of those who fell, the rest
of our regiment escaped.</p>

<p>Soon after, General Prentiss retreating with the
remainder of his troops, came upon our camp ground,
and looking forward, saw the gap closed through which
he had hoped to escape. Exposed to a concentrated
fire from all sides, his regiments completely broken,
there was no alternative but to surrender. The officer
who received the surrender of Major Stone, a major of a
Tennessee regiment, received also that of Gen. Prentiss.
The regiments captured here were the 8th, 12th, and
14th Iowa, and the 58th Illinois.</p>

<p>The capture of General Prentiss affords a most
striking example of the reward the most meritorious
conduct may sometimes receive at the hands of public
opinion. Because he held the field with a handful of
troops, regardless of the number against him, and finally
retreated, not to escape danger, but, when he saw
the enemy surrounding him, to escape capture;&mdash;because
he was thus willing to sacrifice himself, if necessary,
to hold the enemy in check and save the army, the
imputation of cowardice was cast upon him and the
brave men who were captured with him. His fault consisted
alone in not knowing when to retreat; theirs in
obeying their general too well. The same imputation
was cast upon Major Stone, and used against him in
the late gubernatorial campaign in Iowa, by his political
and personal enemies. It is vain to say that a man
exhibited a lack of courage in a day of battle at its
close, who, through all its storm from early in the morning,
had fought so bravely and so well;&mdash;and this, too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
because he was too tardy in retreat! But he has since
triumphed gloriously at Vicksburg, and in the hearts
of the people of Iowa.</p>

<p>I have always believed that this effort of General
Prentiss delayed the enemy an hour, and prevented the
capture of our army. It was about five o'clock when
he surrendered. A mile behind him, and near the
landing, the army was forming its last line of resistance.
Toward this one point the retreat had converged from
all parts of the field. Here the troops were crowded
together in disorderly masses. Men were separated
from their colors, and mixed in inextricable confusion.
There were no longer any regiments, brigades or divisions.
All was an immense mob&mdash;a great rout, halting
because it could retreat no further. This was the grand
army which yesterday surveyed itself so proudly!
To-night it looked at itself and was appalled. The
stoutest hearts sickened at the sight. Officers called
upon their men to rally, but they did not heed them.
Every one seemed to think that their commands did not
apply to him. Men looked blankly into each other's
countenances, and read only their own dismay. But
the delay of the enemy gave time for reflection, and they
began to realize their situation. Behind them was an
impassable river staying their retreat. To plunge into
it was ignominious death. Before was a victorious foe,
coming relentlessly on. To face towards him and fight
was, at least, to die with honor. Many began to be
seized with this heroic resolution.</p>

<p>During the day, Captain Madison had with great difficulty
succeeded in getting four of his siege guns into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
position on the bluffs. The remnants of the broken
regiments had halted and planted their colors near
them. Stragglers came up and joined them, and by
degrees a line of battle grew and extended itself to the
right. Under the direction of Colonel Webster, chief
of staff to General Grant, about thirty pieces of cannon
were got into position along this line and opened upon
the enemy.</p>

<p>For some time we had noticed on the opposite side
of the river a signal flag and a battalion of cavalry.
We heard a band of music playing martial airs. A
strange general was also seen riding with Grant. It
was he!&mdash;It was Buell! The news spread and was
rumored everywhere. "Take courage," our officers
said. "We will hold them till night; to-morrow Buell's
army will be on the field, and we will easily defeat
them." Nevertheless, we had the gloomiest doubts.
Would his troops be here in time? It was an unheard-of
thing in this war for our generals to be in time to
support each other. We were divided between hopes and
doubts, until Ammon's brigade of Nelson's division
marched up the hill.</p>

<p>But we were astonished beyond measure at the
enemy. When there was no longer anything to oppose
him, he had halted. He had delayed an hour when
perseverance alone was necessary to make his victory
complete. When he could have seized the great prize
almost without effort, he declined to take it. He, too,
hesitated at the turning point of his destiny. It was
his fatality and our salvation. But we did not fully
understand his situation. His troops had suffered terribly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
as the assailing party always does when the
assailed fight bravely. They had been broken in the
pursuit well nigh as badly as we in the rout. Many of
his men had straggled from their colors and begun to
plunder our camps. Besides, General Prentiss had
assured him that we had fortifications near the river.
These circumstances decided him to re-form his lines
before making the final assault. Before he could
accomplish this, night began to close upon the scene.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, his right wing was thrown forward to
the river, and moved down against us. But its advance
was obstructed by an almost impassable ravine, at
which point the gunboats Tyler and Lexington attacked
it vigorously. At the same time Ammon confronted
him with his full battalions; and beyond him, behind
our now blazing batteries, a long blue line of infantry
extended. The enemy halted and limited himself to
keeping up a furious cannonade. As if out of respect
to our brave men in front, his missiles almost invariably
passed over their heads and fell among the disgraceful
stragglers in the rear.</p>

<p>Here the scene was humiliating in the extreme. On
the bottom below the landing and in the ravines leading
to it, were thousands of stragglers belonging mostly to
the regiments broken in the morning, whom no efforts
were available to rally. The enemy's shells burst thick
and fast among them. The transports not engaged in
crossing Buell's troops were compelled to anchor in the
stream or tie to the opposite bank, to prevent being
loaded down by them and sunk. Some plunged into
the stream and were drowned, endeavoring to swim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
across. Others swam the bayou which puts into the
river below the landing, and hid themselves in the
woods beyond it.</p>

<p>A furious artillery duel, our gunboats and siege guns
joining with their hoarser voices, was kept up until
night cast its welcome shadows over the scene of horror.
The moon rose and threw a ghastly light upon the
field. The roar of battle gave place to the dull sounds
of moving multitudes in front, and to the noise of transports
crossing and recrossing continually in the rear,
save, when at intervals from one of the gunboats, a jar
of cannon, the noise of a flying projectile, and far to
the front, the crack of an exploding shell, announced to
the enemy that we were not yet wholly his.</p>

<p>All night the troops of Buell continued to cross.
Regiment after regiment filed up the bluff, took position
in line of battle, and awaited the dawn of day.
During the fore part of the night, a moist, warm breeze
blew from the south. About 10 P.&nbsp;M. the sky was
overcast, and there began a drizzling, uncomfortable
rain. Nevertheless, the soldiers, blanketless and weary,
lay down and slept.</p>

<p>No one who has not experienced it knows with what
a sleep a soldier sleeps after a great battle. But ours
was interrupted at regular intervals by the jar of the
gunboat howitzer, which had been ordered to throw shells
during the night to annoy the enemy. Thus awakened
and closing our eyes again to sleep, we saw in our brain-fever
all the terrible images of the day's battle&mdash;hedges
of glittering bayonets; blue masses swaying to and fro;
and that last appalling image, the army in retreat&mdash;gigantic
even in ruin, sublime in its own dismay. These
images, flitting ghostlike and without effort through our
minds seemed to possess the reality of day. Could I
have produced them on canvas as I saw them in my
mind that night, what a panorama it would have been.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>But the generals could not have slept, they were busy
with the preparations for the morning's battle. During
the night two divisions and a part of a third succeeded
in getting across. Lines of battle grew in the darkness
and extended themselves over the hills. All expected
victory. The plan was an admirable one&mdash;to turn the
enemy's right and get possession of the Pittsburg and
Corinth road, his only line of retreat. But of this of
course the men knew nothing. Buell's men were as
weary with marching as we with fighting, and all slept.</p>

<p>The day dawned. Our men arose and awaited the
order to advance. The enemy, too, began to form his
lines of battle. To his soldiers, who knew nothing of
our being reinforced, our capture was expected without
difficulty. "We will have them by eight o'clock," said
some. Others thought we would hold out till nine and
possibly later. Both hosts were full of expectation.
With what a shock, then, would they join! Nevertheless
the enemy formed his ranks slowly. His officers
had to use curses and threats to induce the men to
move with sufficient alacrity. Weary with yesterday's
battle, added to their previous fatigues, a stupor clung
to their limbs which not even a sense of their situation
could dissipate.</p>

<p>Suddenly they heard the reports of rifles. Their
pickets driven in announced the advance of our troops.
In a moment our infantry confronted them. If the
earth had sunk under their feet they could not have
been more stupified. Batteries mounted the crests of
the ridges and thundered at them. Lines of skirmishers
appeared and vanished, followed by full battalions advancing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
at a charge and shouting victory! victory! It
was not possible that the broken host of yesterday had
renewed its strength and were turning upon them. No,
Buell was on the field. They realized it immediately,
expected the worst, and determined to meet the shock
like men.</p>

<p>The Fourth Division rested at this time on the bluffs
as a reserve. We listened with great impatience to the
noise of battle on the left, and to the frequent reports
that came to us from that part of the field. The firing
rose and continued heavily for two or three hours, growing
the while more and more distant. The end of this
beginning is known. The enemy fought desperately,
inflicting upon us heavy loss, but he was forced back
several miles, losing part of his artillery. By nine
o'clock his stragglers began to pace through the woods
towards Corinth, reporting Buell on the field and the
day lost. By twelve o'clock this part of his lines seems
to have been pushed nearly to Shiloh Springs, and
crumbling and streaming through the woods, is said to
have left the field in rout. Why Buell did not get possession
of the Corinth road is more than the troops who
subsequently passed over this ground could understand.
It must have been owing to the stubborn resistance our
attack met with on the center and right. Here the
battle rose as soon as it was well in progress on
the left, and raged heavily and with varying fortunes
until four o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

<p>About ten o'clock General Hurlbut was ordered to
move forward his division and reinforce the right.
"Here," said the General, looking at his fragments of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
battalions, "is what I am ordered to march against the
enemy." He then ordered the regiments to be counted.
The 3d Iowa numbered one hundred and forty men, and
First Lieutenant George W. Crosley, as ranking officer,
was in command. We moved by the flank, the First
Brigade in advance, and General Hurlbut and Colonel
Pugh at the head of the column. Thus this remnant
of the Fourth Division, gallant men whom nothing could
dismay, led by a general whom in one day they had
learned to love, again moved forward into the battle.
Having advanced perhaps a mile, we came within range
of the enemy's shells, which fell in the rear of our line
in this part of the field with great rapidity. This firing
fortunately did us no damage. We reached the point
we were ordered to support, and the division was drawn
up in front. The battle here raged heavily, and the
line in front of us which was engaged swayed to and fro.</p>

<p>To our right and rear, one of our batteries was engaged
with one of the enemy's, a short distance to our
left and front. The duel they kept up was rapid and
revengeful. They fired shot and shell, which flew
directly over our heads and struck and burst behind us
and before us. A soldier in our ranks expressed the
wonder whether the battery on our right was ours or
the enemy's. A voice from behind him answered, "It
is ours of course." Looking around us we saw General
Hurlbut, seated on his horse and smoking calmly. Such
was the conduct of this brave man. Whatever the danger,
he kept constantly near his line, inspiring us with
his presence, and never omitting a word that could encourage
his meanest soldier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>In front of us we could catch glimpses of the battle.
Regiments advanced, disappeared in the thick woods,
and came back in disorder. It was a succession of successful
and unsuccessful attacks. Now fortune was
with us, and now with the enemy. Behind all the
Fourth Division stood firmly, stayed the retreating
battalions and held the line. Through all, the enemy's
battery held its position and kept up its cannonade.
Its shells seemed omnipresent. Its projectiles falling
far and near to right and left, scaling the tree tops or
crashing through their boughs, it seemed to overlook
the field and talk to the army's whole right wing.</p>

<p>General Hurlbut several times changed the disposition
of his line as circumstances seemed to dictate. A regiment
retreating in confusion by the flank, broke through
it cutting it about the center of our regiment. At this
precise moment, Col. Pugh began to move the brigade
to the left. In the noise and confusion, the command
was not heard by those of the right, and one regiment
thus separated from the rest; nor was the movement
known until the left of the brigade had disappeared.
This portion took position in the reserve line and was
not engaged during the day. The right of the brigade,
however, including about forty of our regiment with our
colors, were to play a very different part.</p>

<p>Col. Emory K. Johnson, of the 28th Illinois, assumed
command, and began immediately to advance the line.
As it moved into more open ground and discovered its
length, it was evident he had command of a greater part
of the brigade. Having advanced a considerable distance,
the line halted and volunteer skirmishers were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
called for. A sufficient number immediately went forward
and when about a hundred and fifty yards to the
front, the line again advanced. The skirmishers soon
discovered the enemy moving by the left flank along
our front in the edge of a wide field. At the same time
skirmishers farther to the left reported him massing
troops in that direction, with the apparent design of
flanking us. Col. Johnson immediately took measures
to meet this movement. He moved his line to the left
perhaps a quarter of a mile and then changed its direction
to the front.</p>

<p>Suddenly we confronted the enemy, standing in compact
line of battle, as if just dressed to begin an advance.
We halted and both lines began a vigorous and
steady fire. On our part there was no swaying nor
straggling. It was a fair stand-up fight, the antagonists
exposed to view, and deliberately shooting each other
down. The enemy must have outnumbered us, for his
right extended some distance beyond our left. It was
a splendid test of the <i>morale</i> of the two forces. Victory
was with us. We had expended from twenty to thirty
rounds of ammunition, when the enemy's line gave way
and ours followed at a charge. We pushed him to the
edge of a field, over which he fled in disorder, suffering
severely under our fire. A part of a battery fell into
our hands, around which dead men and horses lay thickly,
showing how severely it had suffered. The enemy,
escaped across the field, and began a feeble fire from the
opposite side.</p>

<p>All at once our line was ordered to retreat. It fell
back rapidly and not without some disorder, and took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
position with the other troops. I have never been able
to ascertain why this retreat was made. At the time it
was commanded, the enemy's fire was so slight, that
without its being increased we could have easily crossed
the field. Neither part of our regiment was engaged
during the remainder of the day. Fresh troops went
forward to reinforce the right, and the battle raged
with unvarying steadiness all along the line, the enemy
being gradually forced back till about four o'clock,
when he finally disappeared from the field, and the
cavalry rode forward with loud shouts to pursue. We
who knew nothing of the ineffectiveness of cavalry
against infantry, and especially untrained cavalry, and
on a timbered field, expected them to perform prodigies
in disorganizing the retreating enemy. But when we
learned they had only followed him a short distance,
picking up a few stragglers, "the man on the horse"
sunk profoundly low in our estimation. As it was,
they doubtless did all they could. Breckinridge's
division covered the enemy's retreat, and presented a
strong front to them when they approached.</p>

<p>The soldiers now expected the order to pursue. It
is now almost useless to inquire why this was not done;
but history will demand to know why nearly two months
of hardship and suffering, including the recall of the
army of the Mississippi from its theater of successful
operations, was required to force the evacuation of
Corinth, which might now have been accomplished by
twenty-four hours vigorous action. General Grant's
apology for not pursuing the enemy is expressed in his
official report: "My force was too much fatigued during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
two days hard fighting, and exposed in the open air to
a drenching rain during the intervening night, to pursue
immediately. Night closed in cloudy and with heavy
rain, making the roads impracticable for artillery by
the next morning." This statement admits of some
qualification. None of Buell's army had been engaged
but one day; and of this but a part of Wood's Division,
and none of Thomas' had been engaged at all. The
latter, though greatly fatigued by the long and hurrying
march they had made to reach the scene of conflict,
were eager to participate in the honors of the occasion,
and might have been advantageously used in the pursuit.
At least, were we not as able to pursue as the enemy
to retreat? He had suffered as much in fatigue as we,
and proportionally far more in the losses of the battle.
He had marched against us expecting everything, and
had gained nothing but slaughter and defeat. His right
wing had left the field in rout. His whole army, conscious
of our now superior strength and of their utter
inability to make a stand against us, whatever the
position they might take, was retreating demoralized
on a single road which defiled for twenty miles through
an almost uninterrupted forest, and which was now
almost impassable for his artillery and train. Before
reaching Corinth his retreat had degenerated into a
rout, and his army had dissolved into a disorganized
and straggling multitude. If we may believe the concurrent
accounts of citizens, added to those of his own
soldiers whom we subsequently captured, such was their
dismay, that a pursuit conducted with ordinary skill
and vigor, would have resulted in immense captures of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
men and <i>materiel</i>. The enemy succeeded in getting his
artillery through to Corinth after the night's rain, which
General Grant avers made the road impassable for
artillery. But had this been the case, a successful pursuit
could have been made without doubt by infantry
and cavalry alone. Who then shall say, that, within
the utmost scope of endurance, General Grant should
not have pursued as soon as the enemy retreated?
The soldiers seemed to think so, and murmured because
it was not attempted.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, whole regiments dissolved into squads
and scattered over the field in search of their dead and
wounded; and it was not long before the entire field
was covered with stragglers and plunderers of the dead.
To put a stop to this, the cavalry was ordered to get up
a panic among them. They rode frantically over the
field, circulating the report that the enemy's cavalry was
upon them. The effect was admirable. In a few minutes
the panic communicated itself to all parts of the
field, and stragglers without number poured through the
woods toward the river like herds of frightened brutes.
No one could tell what he was running from. Each saw
his fellow straggler run and followed him, seized and
mastered by an indefinable, vague dread. At one point
an officer, meeting a gang of stragglers, advised them
to congregate for their safety upon an open field which
was without a fence! The simpletons actually followed
his advice.</p>

<p>General Sherman pursued the enemy a short distance
and returned. The men of our regiment, after collecting
their wounded and most of their dead, assembled at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
our regimental camp. Through the energy and prudence
of Quartermaster Clark, during the forenoon of
Monday, our tents had been let down to the ground and
our baggage hauled to the landing. Thus the former
were saved from being greatly injured by the missiles
of the battle, and the latter from capture by the enemy.
The baggage was not brought up till the next day. We
divided and ate a little food, put up our tents, and without
covering lay down to rest. With blankets for their
shrouds our dead comrades lay near us. Scattered over
the field were thousands of wounded whose sufferings
we could not alleviate. Under ordinary circumstances
it would seem that men in this situation would scarcely
wish to sleep at all. But we slept a sound and joyous
sleep.</p>

<p>All night it rained heavily and with scarcely a moment's
intermission. Storm, darkness and gloom&mdash;a
fitting termination of those two dreadful days.</p>

<p>Drenched by the rain and without covering, the
troops of Buell had lain all night on the advance portions
of the field in line of battle. In the morning many
of them began to discharge their pieces to get the wet
loads out of them. These reports caused great consternation
among the stragglers in their rear, who fled
toward the river firing their pieces as if to repeat the
alarm. For some time we did not heed these noises;
but soon hosts of stragglers, most of them armed, began
to pour through our camp, reporting that the enemy
was renewing the attack. Our teamsters began to hitch
up their mules; our sutler gathered up his books and
commenced a retreat toward the landing. In a moment
our regiment was in line. Captain Smith was in command.
We joined the 32d Illinois on our left and
stretched our line across the road which ran between
their camp and ours, thus intercepting the terror-stricken
herd that poured down it, and compelling them to take
positions in our ranks. We stacked arms and broke
ranks as soon as the panic had subsided.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>During the afternoon, I yielded to curiosity, and with
some comrades took a stroll over the field. From our
extreme front camps to the river, and for three or four
miles to right and left, the dead were everywhere to be
found. Upon the crests of certain hills, in camps and in
open fields they lay more thickly than elsewhere. One
could discern with unmistakable certainty on what parts
of the field the battle had raged with greatest fury.
Nowhere did the enemy's dead lay so thickly as on the
open field behind which the First Brigade of the Fourth
Division had fought on Sunday, and nowhere did our
own dead lay so thickly as at certain points to the right
and left of it.</p>

<p>Soldiers were scattered everywhere over the field,
some prompted by curiosity, some by a desire to revisit
some particular spot where his regiment had fought and
suffered, where some dear comrade had fallen, or where
he had witnessed while it was taking place, some particular
feature of the battle, and some by a desire to
plunder the dead.</p>

<p>For ourselves, we paid particular attention to the
position our regiment had held for five hours on Sunday.
"Here," said we, "we repulsed the charge on the field
and piled up the enemy's dead. Here Mann's Battery
engaged the enemy; here we supported the steel guns
and here the 2d Michigan. And what a storm was here!
And here was our first, and here our second position
in retreat; and here we made our last stand, and
then&mdash;&mdash;".</p>

<p>The dead presented every possible appearance. Some
of them looked calm and natural as if taking a quiet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
sleep; not a mark of any emotion; not a distorted line
in their features. It did not seem possible that these
men could have fallen in battle. Other countenances
exhibited traces of rage; others of fear. One rebel lay
dead holding a cartridge in his teeth. We noticed that
the countenances of our own dead seemed much more
natural than those of the enemy.</p>

<p>As to the appearance of the wounds which caused
death, no general idea can be given. Some did not
seem to be wounded at all, but only asleep. There were
no traces of violence or injury upon them, except, perhaps,
the hair in a particular place would be clotted with
blood. Under it, a buckshot had perhaps penetrated the
skull. Many were shot in the face, and showed a ball
hole under the eye or on either cheek, and a pool of
clotted blood under the head. Many were shot in the
chest and abdomen. Their bodies were swelled enormously,
and a watery liquid bubbled and gurgled from
their wounds. Some of their eyes were closed. Others
lay on their backs, staring an unearthly stare, as though
the light of a strange world were breaking on them.
Some bore evidences of having expired in great agony,
and looked sickening in the extreme. Their eyes were
grim, their faces yellow and their mouths filled with
foam. Other bodies were torn to pieces, as if by the
explosion of a percussion shell. Others were disembowelled
by canister, and beheaded, unlimbed and cut
in two with solid shot.</p>

<p>Less than a mile from the landing, five of the enemy's
dead lay in a row behind a tree. They were evidently
killed by the same missile. The skull of the first was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
torn open on one side; the second was struck in the
neck, the third in the chest, and so on, as though a
descending shell had struck them while standing behind
the tree in a row. Near them were two other bodies
which bore evidence of having been killed by an
exploding shell.</p>

<p>After surveying the field and its multitude of dead,
I returned, sickened, depressed, and disgusted with all
things. Was it possible that such masses of corruption
had been the dwelling places of immortal souls? Could
spirits inhabit such foul tenements, and then fly to the
stars? Such were the temples in which the images of
God were appointed to dwell,&mdash;beautiful, it may be,
when whole; but when broken, how monstrous! I hated
myself because I was flesh and blood. I could have
killed myself, had it not been for the thought of becoming
like them. I was equally disgusted with war, with
peace, with life. I hated peace; for looking back upon
it, it seemed cowardly. I hated war; for it was a work
of destruction. It was against life, that is to say,
against God. I hated life; because it was a scene
either of war or of peace. For a while it seemed to me
as though men were made only to play a little, worthless
game, and then sink into nothingness. To such an
extent were my feelings depressed, while contemplating
this sickening scene of horror.</p>

<p>After the battle came the sad duty of caring for the
wounded and burying the dead. Late as Tuesday evening
we saw ambulances bringing in the wounded; and
Thursday night many of the dead were unburied. It
must not be supposed that our army thus neglected its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
own dead. It was the first duty with the men of the
Third Iowa to bury their dead comrades. It was done
as well as circumstances would permit, and head-boards
were placed at the graves with suitable inscriptions.
How the wounded were cared for, they and their attendants
best can tell. They were placed upon hospital
boats, and sent as rapidly as possible to northern hospitals.
Fatigue parties were detailed to bury the enemy's
dead. After the first day after the battle, this duty was
anything but agreeable. Immense pits were dug where
the dead lay thickest, to which the bodies were dragged
by means of horses and then thrown in and buried.
Thus were the heroes rewarded with nameless graves.
But as they had been comrades in peril, they were now
comrades in their last resting-place. To some of these
graves our soldiers had placed head-boards. I noticed
one with an inscription like this:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Fourteen Dead Rebels</span>,<br />
<span class="smcap">Killed April 6th and 7th</span>,<br />
1862.<br />
</p>

<p>On the cotton field where we had fought on Sunday, it
was said that one hundred and thirty had been buried
in one of these pits. Most of our regiments buried
their dead by themselves, thus forming a little regimental
cemetery, around which they built an enclosure.
The tardiness and carelessness with which the enemy's
dead were buried was a disgrace to our army. Wednesday
afternoon, I saw putrid corpses lying upon an open
field within ten rods of General Nelson's tent, and in
plain view of it.</p>

<p>There were more men ready to engage in plundering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
the dead, than voluntarily to assist in burying them;&mdash;hyenas
in uniform; vermin who creep over the field
of battle by night and rifle the pockets of the slain,&mdash;who
pull the boots from their feet, and cut off their
fingers for the rings that are on them; birds of prey
too despicable to be classed with buzzards,&mdash;who are too
cowardly to pursue living game; but who skulk in the
rear in battle, and when it is over, go forth and plunder
alike friend and foe, whose arms can no longer strike,
and whose voices can no longer rebuke them. Crawling
over the field by night; skulking through the woods by
day; when you meet them they tell you they are in
search of dead or wounded comrades; they entertain
you with tales of their own marvelous exploits in the
battle. But if you watch them, it will not be many days
before they will have "trophies" to exhibit,&mdash;swords,
money, watches, jewelry. There is but one way to deal
with such persons. To give them trial by court martial,
is to insult discipline and to abuse the service. Mounted
patrols should be detailed to scour the field after a
battle, and should shoot without questioning whoever is
caught plundering the dead. I do not mean to say that
valuable property should be buried with dead men. But
the dead should be collected and buried in the usual way,
and their effects retained or disposed of by the proper
officers for the benefit of the Government.</p>

<p>After a lapse of a few days, an army of civilians
appeared on the field;&mdash;men who had come in search
of missing friends, or to care for wounded ones,&mdash;agents
of Sanitary Commissions sent to nurse the wounded,
and having charge of stores for their benefit, who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
according to report, lived upon the stores and spent
their time rambling over the field in search of relics and
gratifying curiosity. They permeated the woods like a
host of locusts. It was the especial delight of the boys
to impose upon them. A soldier would cut a small
stick, shoot two or three holes in it from his revolver,
and sell it to one of them for a dollar as a cane cut from
the battle-field. A soldier found an old, rusty, musician's
sword, and sold it to a civilian for ten dollars, stating
that he had captured it from a rebel officer! Many
such tricks were practiced both to our amusement and
profit.</p>

<p>The battle changed materially the <i>morale</i> of the army.
It had diminished our inclination to boast. If it
had not taught us to respect ourselves less, it had
taught us to respect our enemies more. It diminished
our confidence in General Grant, and greatly increased
it in General Hurlbut. From the former, a general
without experience and an army equally so, it is true
we could not reasonably expect more than tolerable
management. But he had allowed an immense army
to march upon him and surprise him, and that surprise
had entailed upon us defeat, and, to a certain degree,
dishonor. The conduct of the latter won our unbounded
admiration. We had expected nothing of him; he had
done everything for us. If the country did not know
it, we nevertheless felt it&mdash;that the Fourth Division under
his leadership had covered itself with glory.</p>

<p>On Sunday the enemy had beaten us by superiority
of numbers, by having his plans laid and his dispositions
for the battle made without our knowledge, and without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
any interruption from us, and, finally, by the advantage
gained in the attack being a complete surprise to us.
Of these, his advantage in superiority of numbers is the
only one that has been questioned. The most moderate
estimates from the enemy's side have placed his force
at about forty thousand. No one who knows that our
army was so much reduced by sickness and other causes
that not more than half the men borne on its rolls were
available for the line of battle, will believe that we had
more than thirty thousand actually engaged. I have
no doubt, that in the afternoon the enemy opposed us
on the left with two to one. We believed that this battle
had demonstrated the superiority of the enemy's generals;
but at least the equal bravery of our own troops.
His prisoners admitted that they had not imagined we
would fight so well. We told them in reply that we
were all Americans, the only difference between us
being of ideas and education. If we were to believe
what the newspapers at home said of us, we were both
heroes and cowards. We knew that if we had achieved
nothing splendid, we were at least victors. Though we
knew that we had not won much glory, we felt that we
had merited much more than we had won. On the
whole, we were disposed to rejoice, not so much on
account of the bare victory we had gained, as that the
army had escaped, though narrowly, from the utter ruin
which hung over it.</p>

<p>Finally, the following orders of thanks and congratulation
came, the two latter of which, and particularly
the one of Governor Andrew, brought tears to the eyes
of stout soldiers as they were read on parade:&mdash;</p>

<p>While congratulating the troops on their glorious

when they fell back it was in order, and that the last line

this Division. Let them remember that on the morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>

<p>But when we looked through the ranks of our regiment
and surveyed our losses, there was left us little
room for joy or congratulation. Of the four hundred
and fifty who had marched into the battle under our flag
on Monday morning, twenty-eight were killed, and over
two hundred were killed, wounded and missing. Of our
officers, Stone was captured; Hobbs was killed; O'Niel,
Knight, Merrill and Wayne were wounded and captured;
and Trumbull, Ogg, Weiser, Tullis and Hammill
were wounded. In addition to this, Williams, whom we
claimed was disabled while commanding the brigade, and
while doing his duty bravely and well. Many regiments
of the different divisions had suffered as much, and some
perhaps more than ours. It was a poor satisfaction
that the enemy's dead outnumbered our own. The
only joy we could derive from a knowledge of his sufferings
was that it would diminish his strength for the next
battle. The field attested that his killed outnumbered
ours by at least one-third. But his prisoners in our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
hands asserted that their dead in proportion to their
wounded was unusually large. When both sides of the
question shall have been fully heard in reference to this
great battle, it will be believed that the aggregate losses
of the two contending forces were very nearly equal.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Adding together our own and the enemy's dead, and
including those who died of wounds and disease, at least
four thousand men were buried on the field of Shiloh.
And here, breathing a foul atmosphere, drinking a
sickening water, and surrounded by loathsome and
gloomy associations, we remained for three weeks&mdash;in
camp on a field of graves.</p>

moved out and camped in line, Buell to the left of Grant.
The Army of the Mississippi, called from its operations
before Fort Randolph to reinforce us, disembarked at
Hamburg and took post as the left corps of the army,
thus throwing Buell in the center and Grant on the
right. Grant was second, Buell third in command.
McClernand and Wallace's divisions were detached as
the reserve of the army under McClernand. Immense
supplies were collected, and large quantities of clothing
were issued to the troops. Those of the sick, who, in
the opinion of the medical officers, would not be fit for
duty in thirty days, were sent to the hospital boats and
thence to northern hospitals. Fatigue parties under
commissioned officers were detailed each day to repair
and construct roads in the rear of the army.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>The sanitary condition of the army was anything but
flattering. Of our own regiment which, so far as we
could hear, was a type of all the rest, very few were
even in tolerable health. Fevers and camp diarrh&oelig;a
filled the hospitals to overflowing; the sick lists increased
rapidly; and the great extent to which the army
was weakened in numbers by sickness, became a just
source of alarm. It became painfully evident, too, that
its <i>morale</i> was being greatly impaired by the same cause.
For disease weakens the mind as well as the body;
lingering, obtuse pains bring on a state of settled melancholy;
the approaching heats of summer afforded no
hope of an improvement in our sanitary condition; and,
besides, we were beyond the reach of home comforts and
the ministrations of bosom friends. It will not be surprising,
then, that many good soldiers were possessed
of a <i>homesickness</i>&mdash;a desire to be sent home on furlough
or discharged, that amounted almost to a mania.</p>

<p>But if the troops were not buoyant in spirit, they
were nevertheless determined. A beaten enemy was
before us; we knew the responsibility upon us; and
with what expectations the country looked to us; we
had no reason to distrust the capacity of our commanding
general. Under such circumstances, cravens would
scarcely wish to turn back. In addition to this, it is
plain to all that there was a spirit of rivalry between
the army of the Tennessee and that of the Ohio. The
latter army had come upon the field of Shiloh as a reinforcement,
and had surprised and assisted in defeating
an exhausted enemy; and for this, popular opinion at
the North, forgetting Donelson and the bloody struggle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
of April 6th, inquiring not into causes, but looking
only at results, had, with a degree of stupidity and
injustice to which the age affords no parallel, awarded
to them the greater share of glory. The army of the
Tennessee, from its highest officers to its meanest
soldiers, felt the slight most keenly, and resolved to
equal at Corinth, with their decimated battalions, all that
Buell could do with his full ones. The army of the
Tennessee, having suffered reverses and finally triumphed
in two great battles, had learned well the
character of its foes, and that nothing could be achieved
over them except by steady and persistent bravery.
They knew their enemy, and how to fight him. They
had already become veterans. The same may be said
to a certain extent of the army of the Ohio. Those of
this army who had not been engaged at Shiloh, together
with the army of the Mississippi, which, without a test
of its valor, had accomplished by endurance and the
skill of its leader alone, by far the most brilliant exploit
of the war, longed to win for themselves that which the
other troops of the army possessed, the glory which
alone is won in battle; and hence, though perhaps less
reliable and much more enthusiastic, they welcomed the
expected conflict with joy.</p>

<p>Near the middle of April, Grant and Buell moved out
and camped in line. Toward the end of the month the
general advance commenced. Let us now dismiss our
observations concerning the army, the great whole of
which, we, the Third Iowa, were but a little part, and
turn to our regiment, brigade and division; for here we
were at home and among comrades, now scarcely less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
in our regiment than in our division, where all followed
and had faith in a common leader, and had a common
glory won and to win.</p>

<p>Captain Smith was in command of our regiment.
The Third Brigade had been discontinued, and General
Lauman was assigned to the command of the First
Brigade.</p>

<p>April 24th, the division broke up camp and moved
forward to Shiloh Springs, where it camped with McClernand
on its right, Sherman on its left, and Wallace in
the rear. The camp of our regiment was on a beautiful
open field, a quarter of a mile to the rear of the Springs.
We found here in a block house a rebel hospital, and
near our camp the brush and saplings were cut down so
as to form a sort of abattis. This had been done by
the enemy in his retreat. The improvement in air and
water, scenery and associations, rendered our change of
camp highly beneficial.</p>

<p>Here for the first time since landing at Pittsburg we
began to do picket duty. This duty was no unimportant
part of the details of the advance upon Corinth. Each
division picketed its own front under a division picket
officer. Our brigade furnished each day for picket 150
men with the proper complement of officers. The picket
line was here about a mile and a half in advance of the
camps. Our infantry picket line, unless circumstances
determined otherwise, was aimed to be disposed as follows:
One half in reserve; the other half in a line
composed of squads of six men each under a non-commissioned
officer, one hundred and fifty yards in advance
of the reserves. Each of these squads was divided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
into three reliefs of two men each, and a chain of sentries,
two at a post, stationary and as much as possible
concealed from view, was kept up still in advance. Beyond
all on the roads were the cavalry videttes. Here,
though the picketing was sometimes badly, and even
shamefully performed through the negligence of officers,
we were learning for the first time since being in the service
to do picket duty well. Our picket line thus admirably
formed was a complete safeguard against surprise,
and was so strong that it would have resisted the enemy
long enough for the troops in the rear to form line of
battle before being attacked. A similar picket line
before the battle of Shiloh would have done much to
prevent the disastrous surprise of Sunday morning. It
was estimated that throughout the army not less than
ten thousand men were detailed for picket duty each
day.</p>

<p>The degree of pleasure we took in this work depended
greatly upon circumstances&mdash;the officers in command,
the character of the country where we were posted, the
state of the weather, and the degree of vigilance necessary
to be kept up. I have a vivid recollection of a
day on picket in front of Shiloh Springs. Capt. Wright,
53d Illinois, was picket officer for the brigade that day.
He posted the men admirably; he impressed upon them
by words and manner the responsibility of the position,
and maintained throughout the entire tour a degree of
vigilance which it was really a lesson to contemplate.
Not a man even in the brigade reserve was allowed to
take off his accoutrements or sleep day or night. It
was a delightful day, a soft breeze blowing and the sun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
warm. Nothing of the offensive effluvia of the camps;
but the woods all fragrant and green and unmangled by
the axes of soldiers. None of the constant and wearisome
clamor of voices as in the camps; but a quiet
siesta under the shady oaks, breathing the sweet air,
and hearing only the birds, and the distant bands discoursing
martial airs. During the day the detail from
the 3d Iowa was in reserve. We were allowed to kindle
in a hollow a small fire over which to cook our coffee
and fry our bacon. We had long since learned to ask
for nothing better than pilot bread, and that a piece of
meat broiled on a stick or in the ashes, is as sweet as
when cooked in a pan. One or two unlucky porkers
strayed close to us, and were covertly put out of the
way. Of course the good old captain was sure not to
know how we got the fresh meat we had for dinner.
Could we be blamed for that?&mdash;we who so long had
tasted nothing better than salt bacon and hard crackers?
Certainly not. The old captain, whatever his
suspicions might have been, did not object to a slice
himself. Toward evening, our good friend, General
Hurlbut, always ready to give us good news when it
came, but never particular about publishing any that
was bad, sent an orderly to read to us a dispatch that
Farragut had captured New Orleans. We were not
allowed to cheer, but it seemed as though there would
no end to our rejoicing. So great was our joy that we
endured almost with a gusto the drenching rain that set
in about dark, when we took position in the advanced
line. Still we could have rejoiced full as well in our
dry tents. For in Tennessee "when it rains it pours."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
The air is full of rain. The clouds break away until
you can see the stars through them, and still it rains.
But to-night the clouds nowhere broke away, but hung
over us, the rain pouring down without interruption till
gray morning. Of course we were not allowed to kindle
fires in the night, especially upon the advanced line.
We had no artificial shelters, and were compelled to
stand up and&mdash;let it rain. At daylight we were relieved
and put in reserve, and at ten o'clock the new guard
marched up, and we returned to camp.</p>

<p>April 27th, the 1st Brigade was reviewed and inspected
by Brig. Gen. J&mdash;&mdash;, Inspector General for the
Army of the West. This officer was a model in his way.
His dress and horse equipments looked splendid. He
looked altogether out of place. It was the parade general,
gorgeously dressed, without a speck of dirt upon
his horse or uniform. His almost beardless face white
and delicate as though he had been raised in a bandbox,
coming among a host of sunburnt soldiers on active
duty, whose guns were rusty on the outside from exposure
in constant rains, and whose single suit of
clothing, greasy from handling and cooking rations,
and dirty from wading and sleeping in the mud, fell far
short of his standard of soldierly appearance. His
look, so imperious and haughty, was sufficient to set us
to hating him from the first. We could not but observe
that he never turned his head, but only his eyes, to
look at us, and that when our colors passed him in
review, he did not uncover his head as our own generals
were wont to do, but only slightly lifted his hat. Still
he went through his work with a rapidity and precision<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
which astonished us, and left upon us the impression
that he was a valuable officer to the service, and an
extraordinary man in his way.</p>

<p>April 30th, we had just finished our monthly inspection,
when orders came for the division to advance.
Leaving our sick behind and taking all our baggage,
we moved on the main Corinth road about five miles to
the southwest. We passed on the way wagons, caissons,
knapsacks, clothing, and other evidences of the
enemy's retreat. We also passed a dilapidated log
building house, and near it a deserted rebel camp, full
of tents, destroyed commissary stores, clothing, and
camp equipage, everything indicating a hasty evacuation.
We camped on what is known as Pea Ridge, a
high backbone of country, four miles from Shiloh
Springs and nine from Pittsburg Landing. From this
commanding eminence we could look around us over a
wide space of country. The whole army was advancing
in columns, moving upon different roads. The hour of
expected bloody work was drawing nigh. Sherman
with the 5th Division had the honor of forming the right
of the army. With twelve regiments of infantry and
one of cavalry he had the enormous complement of nine
batteries of artillery. He was now camped on the Corinth
road a short distance beyond us, while McClernand
and Wallace were about two miles in our rear.</p>

<p>Our camp was dry and airy, and the water was passable.
We constructed ovens of clay; for a part of our
bread ration was now drawn in flour, and it took us
some time to learn to accommodate ourselves to the use
of the iron bake-kettle of which the deserted camp we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
had just passed furnished a goodly supply. These
ovens were constructed by driving four crotches into
the ground, and upon these placing two sticks, upon
which was laid a floor of short poles. Upon this we
piled a compact layer of clay mortar eight or ten inches
thick. Then a flour barrel, open at the top and with a
hole about six inches square cut in the side near the
other end, was laid upon this with the hole upward
where the chimney would be built, as a support for the
soft clay. As soon as this was completed and the
chimney built, a fire would be kindled in the barrel,
and as soon as it had burned out and the staves fallen
in, the clay would be sufficiently dry to support itself.
These ovens subserved their purpose excellently, and
furnished many a meal of warm biscuit and light bread,
such as reminded us of home. We had begun to fix up
our tents, too&mdash;to construct hickory bark cots; for here
we could get no boards&mdash;and to get ourselves in shape
to be comfortable, when up came another order for the
division to advance next morning, May 4th, at 7 o'clock.
Those of the sick who would be unable to do duty in
ten days were to remain behind under charge of a medical
officer. But three tents to the company were to be
taken&mdash;one for the officers and two for the men. We
were to take three days' cooked rations in haversacks.
About 4 P.&nbsp;M. of the 3d, while we were making preparations
for the march, a cannonade commenced three
or four miles to the south and continued for over
an hour with rapid and sharp discharges. It was
said to be Pope's Parrott guns shelling the enemy
out of Farmington. This seemed ominous of something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
to come. But we continued our preparations
undisturbed.</p>

<p>The morning was heavy with clouds, and the column
was scarcely in motion when a drizzling rain set in.
We first passed through the camp of Sherman, just
evacuated. We noticed that much commissary and
sutler's stores had been abandoned, which we afterwards
learned were appropriated and made good use
of by the sick we had left behind. Here we left the
Corinth way and bore more to the right. Near the
late camp of the 6th Iowa, we noticed a short line of
rifle pits which had been dug by that regiment. It was
an insignificant work, but it was the first we had seen
in Tennessee since landing at Pittsburg. It had been
made to protect the right wing of Sherman's line. It
shook our confidence in our efficiency against the enemy
we were to encounter. It almost made us afraid. Still
we could not but regard it as a wise precaution. We
moved slowly, constructing bridges and corduroy roads
as we advanced. Late in the afternoon, we passed
through Monterey, a town of one or two houses, dignified
by being built on a hill. About a mile beyond
we went into camp. The roads were almost impassable.
Our teams foundered and our wagons sunk to the hubs
in the mud. I could conceive of no situation more unenviable
than that of teamster that day. It was really
noon the next day before our baggage was able to arrive.
Wet and fatigued, we made us beds of leaves, wrapped
up in our blankets, and passed without other covering a
night of incessant rain.</p>

<p>The following day we had pitched our tents, dried our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
clothes, and commenced building ovens and cooking
fresh rations, when an order came to march that night
or in the morning. Next morning at eight o'clock we
loaded our baggage and again moved forward. We
passed Sherman's yesterday camp along the right of
which, and fronting to the west, was a line of rifle pits
defended by an abattis. Just as we had got beyond
these works, McLean's division marched up and occupied
them. After proceeding about two miles, the
division was deployed in line facing toward the south,
and we thus went into camp.</p>

<p>The single day that we stayed here was marked by
two incidents, the news of the evacuation of Yorktown,
which gave us great joy, and the affectionate farewell
of Mr. Fox, our legitimate sutler. This man had first
joined us at Chillicothe, Missouri. He had been allowed
by our different regimental commanders to neglect and
abuse the functions of his office most shamefully. He
had never consulted our wants, but his own profit and
convenience. When we had money and he competition,
he sold reasonably; but when we were without money
or were where we could buy of no one but him, he
charged exorbitant prices for his goods. On the
march or transport, and after hard marches or long
movements, when we needed a sutler most, we were
sure to be without one. When we had been some days
in camp at Pittsburg Landing, he had joined us with a
meager stock, having left most of his goods with his
partner who had established a store at Savannah.
When we broke up camp here and advanced, he found
it more convenient to remain behind and sell to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
transient customers than to follow us immediately.
At this point, however, he came up with an ox-wagon
loaded with goods, pitched a small tent and opened
shop. A party of the boys immediately gathered about
his tent and testified their esteem for him, and their
admiration for the course he had taken, by cutting his
tent ropes and carrying off about a hundred dollars
worth of goods, to which all their comrades said "Amen."
Here our benefactor left us, after exchanging with us
the most complimentary adieus. The next time we
heard of him, he was "relieved from duty," and in
"close confinement" among a lot of butternut prisoners
near the Landing, for being too great an admirer of
a horse that belonged to one of General Halleck's
orderlies.</p>

<p>This night we slept on our arms, and moved forward
in the morning, May 7th, at eight o'clock. While the
division was moving out, the Third Iowa in lead, Gov.
Yates of Illinois rode up with his staff. General Lauman
halted the brigade. Captain Smith announced
"Governor Yates, the man who takes good care of his
soldiers," and the Third Iowa responded with three
loud and hearty cheers. General Lauman then turned
to the Governor and addressed him with a few affecting
remarks, telling him how much gratitude the soldiers
of Iowa owed the State of Illinois&mdash;how her sanitary
agents had ministered to their wants and comforts, and
how, when at Cairo, the 7th Iowa was without blankets
and clothing, the Quartermaster of Illinois generously
supplied them. The Governor responded, that if Illinois
had done her duty in this war, Iowa had also done hers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
Side by side they had stood in the great contest&mdash;side
by side their soldiers had fought on numerous fields&mdash;and
side by side they would continue to stand and fight,
until the national flag should float over the whole
national domain. Whatever Illinois had done for Iowa
she had done for the country and the cause; it was no
more than a patriotic duty, and as such required no
thanks. The Governor rode away amid another outburst
of applause. I noticed, among his staff, the familiar
countenance of my old teacher, Professor Pope, of
Black River Seminary, now a paymaster in the army.
Having moved forward about two miles and a half, the
division formed line facing to the south, stacked arms
and began rapidly to fell the timber and construct an
abattis in front of our position. Here our pickets first
came in contact with those of the enemy, and a picket
skirmish began, which was kept up day and night until
we entered Corinth. It was reported that there was
encamped a short distance ahead of us a detachment of
the enemy with four pieces of cannon. The following
afternoon a part of the picket force belonging to other
regiments of the brigade, ran in a panic and reported
the enemy advancing. The enemy's cavalry had indeed
attacked the picket line and a sharp skirmish was taking
place. The drummer sounded the long roll, and the
regiments formed line. Generals Hurlbut and Lauman
rode past our regiment as we stood in ranks, and we
presented arms to them. General Hurlbut took off his
hat as he passed our flag, and said to Captain Smith:
"Captain, I hope you'll get another inscription on your
flag to-day." The Captain responded, "There is room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
for two or three more, General." When the cause of
the alarm was ascertained, we stacked arms, and every
man was ordered out to dig fortifications. Before night
our position was covered by a passable line of rifle
pits.</p>

<p>The following day was Sunday. There was a lull in
the picket firing as though both parties respected it as
a day of rest. Religious services were held in the
camps of the regiments near us. Fatigue parties were
kept at work on the rifle pits; but as the day was hot
and sultry, little was done besides building before their
exterior slopes a hedgework of brush and fallen tree
tops. Each day brought the expected battle nearer to
us. We were ready for it. It was while here that
orders from General Hurlbut announced the capture of
Norfolk Navy Yard, the destruction of the Merrimac,
and the destruction of the rebel flotilla at Fort Pillow.
It seemed that success was crowning our arms everywhere,
and that the decisive victory in the West rested
with us and depended upon our valor. We would
achieve it. Such was the spirit of the entire army.
Even the offensive-defensive policy General Halleck
was now pursuing did not discourage us. We were
equally ready to dig ditches or to attack the enemy.</p>

<p>On the 14th we again broke up camp and moved a
mile to the front, the enemy's pickets retiring before us.
We reached our new position about 5 P.&nbsp;M., and before
ten our position was covered by as good a line of works
as we had left. It was astonishing to see with what
alacrity the soldiers worked. They did not stop to
consider the necessity of fortifying when the enemy's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
works were more than five miles from them. The
General had taken this way to drive the enemy from
Corinth. Everything depended upon our prompt obedience
and vigorous co-operation.</p>

<p>Next day also we moved a short distance and entrenched
abreast of Sherman. Here the battle of the
pickets grew more severe than ever, and began to be
varied by frequent cannonading on different points of
the line. We were kept in constant readiness for a
momentary collision with the enemy&mdash;slept on our
arms, had reveille at three o'clock in the morning, and
were frequently ordered into line.</p>

<p>May 17th, orders were issued to cook two days'
rations and be ready again to move. The enemy,
posted in a block house known as Russell's House, had
annoyed our pickets greatly, and in order to advance
the picket line, it became necessary to dislodge him.
For this purpose our regiment, the 32d Illinois, and a
section of Mann's Battery of Hurlbut's Division, went
forward in conjunction with a force from Sherman's.
Mann opened vigorously upon the position for a short
time, when the 8th Missouri, of Sherman's Division,
attacked and carried it at the point of the bayonet,
losing a large number in killed and wounded. By this
feat this gallant regiment made itself a name among us
second to none with which we had ever been associated.
We returned to camp about 9 P.&nbsp;M., and in the night
received orders to move in the morning with rations in
haversacks; but they were countermanded and we did
not move.</p>

<p>At this camp, Colonel Scott joined us. All welcomed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
him joyfully, and regretted that the state of his health
would not permit him to resume command.</p>

<p>May 21st, the right wing of the Army of the Tennessee,
commanded by Major General Thomas, was
ordered to move forward. While the Fourth Division
was advancing, General Davies' artillery shelled back
the enemy's outposts in front of his division. Two batteries
were said to be engaged. The discharges were
rapid and sharp, and as they broke upon us so near
while we were marching to the front, seemed to have a
grim significance. The First Brigade halted on a commanding
ridge and began to throw up works. By a
miscalculation of distance, there was not room for the
2d Brigade to form between our left and Davies' right.
General Veatch accordingly posted two of his regiments,
the 25th Indiana and 15th Illinois, to the right of the
1st Brigade. Before night, a continuous line of works,
capable of resisting field artillery, protected our division
front. In the afternoon, in addition to the usual picket
firing and cannonading, a brisk skirmish had taken
place a short distance to our front. The enemy's
cavalry, as report had it, appeared in Federal uniform
and was driven off. Sherman's line was about half a
mile in advance of Hurlbut's, his left covering our
right.</p>

<p>This night I had my first experience of picketing in
the face of the enemy. After working hard all day, my
company was detailed for picket. Captain (then Lieutenant)
Swank was in command, and Lieutenant Lakin
was with us. Our division picket line extended around
a very large cotton field of irregular shape, and formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
a sort of semicircle, the center retired and the flanks
connecting with Davies on the left and Sherman on the
right. Our position was on the most retired part of this
line, along a little brook, the cotton field being in front
of us. A quarter of a mile in advance of us and to our
right, and joining this field on its southwest corner, was
the left of Sherman's line of works, upon which his men
were at work till nearly midnight, felling trees, dragging
together logs, and banking up the dirt, with the
most boisterous sounds of mirth and glee. Immediately
across this field, in a dense thicket, the enemy had a
picket post, which, strange enough, he had been allowed
to maintain very near to Sherman's flank, and from
which he had skirmished all day with his pickets, across
the field. Where we were posted, the line was crowded
together and very strong. The posts of eight or ten
men each were but four or five rods apart. A strong
reserve was in our rear. The captain threw out videttes
and made dispositions for the night, and then most of
us went to sleep. I had lain by the side of Lieutenant
Jimmy, and endeavoring to derive a little consolation
from the warmth of his body and the flap of his blanket,
had gone to sleep. I was sleeping soundly, when <i>bang!
bang! bang!</i> went the enemy's guns. I sprang to my
feet, and by the time I could get my gun and recollect
where I was, I could see around our entire division line,
and away up the left of Davies', like a hundred meteors
starting from the earth, the flash of rifles from every
advance post. The enemy had doubtless taken this
measure to ascertain our positions, or whether we were
advancing our lines. The next morning these rebels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
were justly chastised for their ungentlemanly conduct
in disturbing our sleep. The detail which relieved us
were ordered by the new officer of the day to deploy as
skirmishers and advance across the field. They obeyed
gallantly; and with a brisk skirmish, but not without
some loss, dislodged the enemy and occupied his position.
Company B of our regiment, had the honor of
participating in this little affair.</p>

<p>The 26th of May, was a day full of excitement.
About 9 A.&nbsp;M., the guns of Pope and Buell opened
heavily upon our left, and about noon, Sherman's chimed
in on our right. Something was to be done. General
Lauman was in the saddle. We fell into ranks and
stood ready. It was not a battle: but the whole line
was advancing.</p>

<p>The next morning the 2d Brigade moved forward and
united with the left of Sherman. Their ambulance corps
with white badges tied to their left arms marched in
rear of their respective regiments. They threw up works
connecting Sherman with Davies, and the 1st Brigade
formed a reserve behind them. All day, as yesterday,
a vigorous cannonade was kept up, varied with occasional
skirmishing by the infantry. The work on the
fortifications continued briskly, and by night a heavy
line of field works with embrasures for cannon was
completed.</p>

<p>And now the morrow, the thirtieth of May, was to
witness the meager fruits of all this preparation and
hardship. At six o'clock in the morning, we heard a
terrible explosion in the direction of Corinth. Our first
impression was, that the enemy had opened with heavy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
guns; but when we saw dense columns of smoke rising
above the tops of the forest, we felt certain that he was
evacuating and blowing up his magazines. About eight
o'clock, General Lauman ran up to the Third Iowa,
shaking his long beard and clapping his hands, almost
frantic with joy. "Boys," cried he, "get ready to
march, we are going into Corinth right away!" The
only response I heard was from the "old veteran," my
comrade: "If the old General says so, we'll do it any
how!" The 8th Missouri had gone forward to reconnoiter,
and found the enemy's works abandoned. There
was an evident strife between Sherman and Hurlbut to
see who should be first in Corinth. It was a running
march through suffocating dust and melting heat. The
infantry rushed on without waiting for the artillery.
The batteries limbered up and galloped past the infantry.
Three-fourths of a mile brought us to the enemy's
works. They consisted, at the point where we passed
through them, only of a tolerable line of rifle pits, but
defended by a heavy abattis a fourth of a mile in width.
All along we met straggling troopers retiring loaded
down with various kinds of plunder, among which were
enormous knives, which looked in shape and size like
the coulters of our Western breaking-plows. Some had
their horses completely loaded down with pikes, shot
guns, and bake ovens. We passed the enemy's late
camps and were soon in Corinth. The excessive heat,
the dust of hurrying battalions and galloping squadrons
and batteries, added to the sickening stench of the deserted
camps, and to the smoke of burning houses and
cotton, were almost unendurable. Sherman took the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
shortest route and reached the town first. His and
Hurlbut's divisions pursued the enemy for several miles
on the Ripley road, but returned to their former camps
before night.</p>

<p>The chase of the day was over, and we were again
behind our works. It was a meager consolation that
we had dug our last ditch for the reduction of Corinth.
There was an indescribable feeling of mortification that
the enemy with all his stores and ordnance had at last
escaped. We could not but think that beyond the occupation
of a little additional territory and a single
strategic point to the enemy, we had gained nothing.
His military organization was still unbroken. He was
as able as before to hurl himself on a weak point, or
to give us battle. We had lost a decisive victory by
tardiness and excess of caution. If Pope had only been
in command, or if Halleck had allowed him to press on
as rapidly as he desired, how different, said we, would
have been the result! And why had we not pressed the
retreat of the enemy, while his soldiers were discouraged
by being forced from so strong a position? Had we no
generals capable of following up a victory? These feelings
were subsequently in a measure relieved by the
reports that Buell and Pope were pressing the main
column of the enemy with splendid results. Yet nothing
transpired to change the general impression that though
we had gained much, what we had gained was entirely
inadequate to the numbers, means and exertions
made use of to gain it. We saw that the enemy had
lost much by being compelled to abandon a position
of such advantage to him, and in the consequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
demoralization of his troops; but we harbored a vague
mistrust that his superior generalship would yet convert
his defeat into a victory; and all seemed to feel
that the subjugation of the South lay a long way
before us.</p>

<p>Among the most interesting recollections of my soldier
life, are those of the period I spent in military
hospitals. Though much of the time my mind was so
enfeebled by disease, as not to observe closely that
which transpired around me; yet, long as I may live,
I shall remember most vividly the sufferings I experienced
while there, sometimes relieved by friends, by
comrades, and by those appointed and detailed to take
care of the sick and wounded; and sometimes in part,
or entirely, neglected. It was there that I saw, more
than anywhere else, human character divested of its
artificial coloring, and exhibited in its brightest tints
and gloomiest shades.</p>

<p>It was there that I contracted a debt of gratitude to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
some that I can never repay, and conceived a hatred
for others that I can never forget. Memories born in
the heart amid scenes like these can never be blotted
out. But glad as I should be to linger over the names
of those who were kind and gentle to me amid these
scenes of sickness and gloom, I shall hasten to consider
those affairs in which my comrades had a more direct
and positive interest.</p>

<p>And here my comrades would have to regret the
absence of a link in the chain of this "grave, interesting
and authentic narrative," had not a comrade who kept
a diary of the wanderings of the Third Iowa, while I
was absent from it during this term of sickness, generously
come to my aid. After describing the scenes
attending the occupation of Corinth, this Cid Hamet
of my history goes on to tell us, that, on the afternoon
of the 2d of June, orders came to the Third Iowa to
march immediately, and before night the 4th and 5th
divisions, under command of Major General W. T. Sherman,
moved out, taking all their baggage, and, passing
through Corinth, camped about a mile to the west of that
place on the south side of the Memphis and Charleston
Railroad. There was no water in this vicinity to relieve
the troops from the effects of the suffocating heat and
dust of the day; but this state of things was somewhat
mitigated by a light shower of rain which fell in the
forepart of the night.</p>

<p>The following morning reveille sounded at daylight,
and an early march, the 5th division in advance, brought
the troops to a small stream of water on the south side
of the railroad, where they established a camp, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
commenced repairing the road about four miles to the
west, so as to enable them to proceed. For this purpose
the Third Iowa furnished a small detail each day.
On the 6th, the regiment changed camp to the north
side of the railroad. This was about seven miles from
Corinth.</p>

<p>On the 10th the troops again moved, and after a
toilsome and dusty march of fifteen miles, both divisions
camped on a commanding bluff that overlooks the
Big Hatchie. As the 4th Division rested upon these
hills, little did its soldiers dream that the valley below
would one day be consecrated with the blood of many
of its members, and that the "Heights of the Hatchie"
would be forever linked in memory with its glorious
achievements, and the prowess of its commander. It
was the "Field of Matamora!" Two days they rested
here, during which time a bridge was thrown across the
Hatchie by the troops of the 5th Division, in place of
the old one which had been burned by the enemy; and
then they moved forward four miles, and camped on a
stream known as the Big Muddy.</p>

<p>Resuming the march the following morning, June
13th, they defiled all day through a desolate waste
of woods, and over dry ridges. The heat was intense.
Save from occasional mudholes, there was no water to
be found. The dust was shoe-top deep and rose in
dense, suffocating clouds, which there was no wind to dispel.
The dreariness of the country was relieved by but
two farm houses during the whole day's march. Notwithstanding
the unparalleled fatigue and suffering, the
men kept in the ranks well, and there was little straggling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
After a march of thirteen miles, they camped
on Spring Creek, a tributary of the Hatchie. Here they
found excellent water, and moved at four o'clock in the
morning about two miles, and rested for the day in the
vicinity of some clear and cold springs.</p>

<p>At five o'clock the next morning the march was
resumed. The men had no water during the day
except what they took in their canteens in the morning.
The march was more fatiguing, if possible, than on any
previous day. They passed through Grand Junction
and found an excellent camping place on Wolf River,
having made a distance of twelve miles.</p>

<p>The following day, the 2d Brigade of the 4th Division
made a reconnoissance towards Ripley; they were gone
two days. There was much straggling from their
ranks, and a number were missing when they returned.
For two or three days afterwards, they continued to
come up and report to the pickets.</p>

<p>After the evacuation of Corinth, Colonel Williams
resumed command of the regiment, and during this
march had begun to renew his obnoxious practices. He
arrested the quartermaster and reduced Hulbert, the
commissary sergeant. Both, however, were vindicated.
The former resigning, was appointed Colonel of the
34th Iowa, and the latter was soon after appointed
sergeant in his own company in which capacity he
served, no one better or more bravely, and was reappointed
commissary sergeant under Lt. Col. Trumbull.</p>

<p>On the 22d of June, the 4th Division moved to a
position near LaGrange, Tenn., the Third Iowa going
into camp on a beautiful wooded hill overlooking Wolf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
River. This village, which, in prosperous times, contained
about 2,000 inhabitants, is beautifully situated
on an eminence which commands a view of ten or twelve
miles of level country to the south of the river. It is
supplied with excellent springs of water, is surrounded
by wide and well cultivated fields, and its elegant
residences, surrounded with costly evergreens, gave
evidence of the cultivation of its inhabitants. It possessed
far more attraction than any town they had yet
seen in Tennessee. It was pleasant indeed, after so
long a sojourn in the gloomy woods, to pitch tents amid
scenes of civilization.</p>

<p>They had advanced slowly from Corinth, had built
on the way two bridges ruined by the rebels, besides
repairing the railroad so that the cars were now running
regularly between LaGrange and that place. The
removal of certain obstructions between LaGrange and
Moscow, a station nine miles to the west, was all that
now remained to put the road in working condition
between Corinth and Memphis. A train coming from
Memphis had been thrown off the track at Moscow.
Part of the soldiers on board marched through to LaGrange
in safety, while those who remained were captured
by guerrillas, who burned the train. Whether
this accident had anything to do with admonishing
General Sherman of the impracticability of holding
with so small a force so long a line of railway parallel
to the enemy's front of operations, my informant does
not pretend to judge. At least this line was soon after
abandoned, and that by way of Jackson and Columbus
opened in its stead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>It seems to have been known that the enemy under
command of Breckenridge, were in the vicinity of Holly
Springs, Miss., a small city twenty-six miles to the
south. This force probably was merely one of observation,
the enemy's main body having retired upon
Grenada. But there came in exaggerated reports of
his immense numbers there, and preparations to attack
us. General Sherman determined to move against him,
the two divisions starting simultaneously the morning
of June 30th, the 4th from LaGrange, the 5th from
Moscow. Two days rations were taken in haversacks.
They camped at night near a brick church, in the neighborhood
of the railroad station of Lamar. There was
no water to be procured here except out of one or two
wells and some dirty pools, at which places there was
such a rush that each regiment was compelled to station
a guard over them while its own men took their
turn.</p>

<p>The next day, July 1st, was cool and pleasant. A
march of seven miles brought the column to Cold Water
River, a small stream, pure and clear. The only incident
of this day's march was that a battalion of the
4th Illinois had been drawn into an ambuscade, losing
four killed and six wounded.</p>

<p>The following day, the 32d and 53d Illinois regiments
went forward to reconnoiter, but discovered
nothing. On their return, they were taken for rebels,
and an alarm throughout the whole force ensued.</p>

<p>The day after this, Lieut. Barnes of General Lauman's
staff, went out with three others to some farm
houses to buy provisions, and were fired upon by bushwhackers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
and all of them wounded. The affair caused
considerable excitement, and threw General Lauman
into a great rage.</p>

<p>The next day was the national anniversary. The
4th Division moved forward and entered without opposition
Holly Springs, "the Saratoga of the South." This
delightful little city is situated on the Mississippi Central
Railroad, contains excellent springs of water, and
was celebrated as a Southern watering place. The
citizens behaved toward their new visitors with as much
insolence as they dared to manifest. Little did they
then, suppose that they were sowing in the bosoms of
these men the seeds of a hatred, which would one day
lay their beautiful city in ashes! The next day the
column started back, and on the 7th again entered
LaGrange and Moscow. During the fortnight my comrades
stayed at the former place few incidents of note
took place. It was here that Lieut. Col. Scott resigned
and left the regiment. There was an universal regret
at being compelled to part with the man who had commanded
us so bravely and befriended us so well. All
felt as though they had lost their best field officer, and
turned with gloom to the prospect of being commanded,
no one could tell how long, by a man who, whatever
might be his merits or faults, had, with scarcely an
exception, lost the confidence and good will of his
men.</p>

<p>One day a forage train of sixty wagons went out in
the direction of Cold Water, guarded by six companies
of the Third Iowa, under Captain Smith. On their
return the escort was menaced by Jackson's cavalry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
who endeavored to capture the train. But the Captain's
tactics were quite equal to those of the rebel Colonel.
He chose open ground and very coolly marched along in
plain view of the enemy. They attempted by demonstrations
to draw his fire, but failed, and finally withdrew,
having for once found their match.</p>

<p>About this time General Grant performed the remarkable
feat of riding in one day from Corinth to
Memphis, unattended except by one company of cavalry,
his body guard and a few staff officers. It must be
remembered that with the exception of the immediate
vicinity of LaGrange and Moscow, where General Sherman's
troops were stationed, the whole country was in
the hands of the enemy. At LaGrange the party halted
an hour for refreshments, and left one of the staff who
had given out. It is said they reached Memphis before
night.</p>

<p>Meanwhile General Sherman and staff proceeded to
Memphis, leaving orders behind that it was his intention
to select at that place grounds for the encampment
of the two divisions, and that no officer or soldier
should be allowed to follow him to that place ahead
of his corps.</p>

<p>July 17th, at 1 P.&nbsp;M., the 4th Division broke up
camp at LaGrange, and moving along the Memphis and
Charleston Railroad, after a tiresome march of nine
miles in which many gave out and fell behind their
regiments, camped for the night at Moscow, from which
place the 5th Division had just moved.</p>

<p>Starting at 3 o'clock next morning, and with little
improvement on yesterday's march in respect of straggling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
although the weather was cooler than usual both
days, the column arrived at Lafayette Station, having
marched ten miles.</p>

<p>The march was resumed at 2 o'clock in the morning,
the 5th Division still in lead. The forenoon was excessively
hot, and marching was difficult in the extreme.
The dust rose in such clouds that a man in the ranks
could scarcely see the comrade ahead of him. Seventeen
miles being accomplished, the column halted for
the night at Germantown.</p>

<p>Next day, the column moved forward six miles to
White Station, and on the day after that, July 21st, a
march of nine miles brought it to Memphis. Foot-sore,
ragged and weary, the battalions marched into the city.
The Third Iowa had the honor of being in lead of the
4th Division. So thick was the dust on men's faces,
that it was difficult to distinguish soldier from contraband&mdash;all
looked alike. Many had no shoes, and some
even were without pants, and had nothing but drawers
and shirt in way of uniform. But the boys dressed
their files and proudly kept step to the music, while
from balconies and windows the Union ladies waved
white handkerchiefs in welcome.</p>

<p>Wallace's division was garrisoning the city, but now
relieved by Sherman, it embarked to reinforce the army
of General Curtis at Helena. General Sherman
disposed his troops so as to environ the city and
guard all the approaches to it. Our regiment being
on the right of the line was camped on the south
side of the city and near the river. We had
a delightful camping ground, greensward beneath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
our feet, and noble shade trees waving over our
heads.</p>

<p>The period we spent here was one of rest but not
of idleness. It was a period of discipline and duty.
We were still in the presence of an enterprising enemy,
who constantly menaced our extended line with attack.
General Sherman was no less a general in camp than
in the field. There his great bravery, his splendid
tactical combinations in the face of the enemy, his
unwearying energy, and his industrious attention to
details, had impressed his soldiers with a kind of
reverence for him as a military commander, which they
felt for no other general. All could see that in genius
and in spirit, he was a complete soldier. Though he
could add nothing to the patriotism and bravery of the
men he commanded, he was now to see they were
better supplied, better drilled, better disciplined, and
that there be infused into them more of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de
corps</i>. Every one will recollect his fine figure on
review&mdash;how keenly he scrutinized every thing; not a
man, nor a uniform, nor a gun seemed to escape his
notice. He exercised the closest supervision over the
different departments, punished corruption and saw
that justice was meted out to all. He administered
martial law in the city of Memphis with justice and
rigor, but without violence or cruelty. A young soldier
studying the profession and practice of arms might well
think himself fortunate in being under the tuition
of such a general.</p>

<p>It was at Memphis that we first were allowed to
admit negroes within our lines. At LaGrange and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
Moscow and all along the march from those places
hither, they had flocked to join us in great numbers.
General Halleck's celebrated General Orders No. 3
being then in force, General Sherman was compelled to
issue an order forbidding his soldiers from encouraging
negroes in leaving their homes, and teamsters from
giving them transportation. This order was written
by Captain Hammond, his Assistant Adjutant General,
and was couched in poor and undignified terms. As
soon, however, as orders from Washington allowed him
to do so, General Sherman issued orders authorizing
the employment of negroes as cooks, teamsters and
laborers in the various departments and on the fortifications.
Large numbers were put to work on Fort
Pickering, an important field work which was projected
for the defense of Memphis. Contrabands thronged
the camps in large numbers, and soon became an
important element in the <i>materiel</i> of the army. All
that came within our lines were received and put to
work, and supplied with clothing and subsistence.
This policy was viewed by the soldiers with very
general approbation.</p>

<p>While we were thus resting, our comrades in the
East were struggling, through prodigious marches,
uncommon hardships, and bloody battles to check the
advance of a superior enemy, and his invasion of our
soil. Reports from that quarter of disaster crowding
upon disaster, disturbed in no small degree the quietude
of our camp life, and embittered the sweets of the
comparative repose we were enjoying. In addition to
this, the enemy began to make demonstrations in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
neighborhood of Bolivar, Tenn., and we were not surprised
to find our spell of easy soldiering broken, when,
on the 5th of September, orders came to march at
3 o'clock next morning, in what direction we could
only conjecture.</p>

<p>The two divisions which had been so long together
were now to be separated. They who had grown to
consider each other comrades, had marched and fought
together perhaps for the last time. General Sherman
expressed his feelings on this separation in the following
letter to General Hurlbut, which, after we had reached
Bolivar, was published to us in General Orders. We
esteemed it a great honor to receive such compliments
from such a general:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right break-before">
<span class="smcap">Headquarters, 5th Division</span>,   }<br />
<span class="smcap">Memphis</span>, Tenn., Sept. 6, 1862.}<br />
</p>
<p class="hang"><i>Brigadier General Hurlbut, Commanding 4th Division</i>,
<i>Army of the Tennessee</i>,&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:&mdash;Permit me through you to convey
to the officers and men of your division an expression
of my deep regret that the necessities of the service
should at this time separate our commands. Our divisions
were the first to disembark at Pittsburg Landing,
in the early part of March, and through storm and sunshine,
adverse and prosperous times, we have been side
by side. Not only have social ties arisen between us,
but the habit of acting together has made us one command;
and I feel in parting with you as though my
own division was divided.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>I need not express to you my high personal and
official respect; for I hope to have evinced it on all
occasions. I must say that no officers could have been
more zealous, close, and attentive to their important
duties than they have been. I can not recall an instance
of their being absent from their posts for even an hour.
Indeed, with very few exceptions, your division is composed
of a class of steady good men, who by their
behavior in camp, on guard, on the march and in battle,
reflect honor and credit on themselves and their
country.</p>

<p>Be pleased to convey to all my hearty thanks; and
assure them that I will hail the change in events which
will bring us again together.</p>

<p>At this time Colonel Williams was seriously ill.
Capt. M. M. Trumbull, of Company I., had been
recommended by the commissioned officers of the regiment
to Governor Kirkwood as their choice to fill the
vacancy occasioned by the resignation of Col. Scott,
and having received since official notice of his appointment,
Colonel Williams had ordered him to assume
command. He accordingly put on the uniform of Lt.
Colonel, and we began to address him by his new title,
rejoiced that, at a time when an encounter with the
enemy seemed probable, we were to be led by an officer
of such gallantry and merit.</p>

<p>The sick, who in the opinion of the surgeons were not
able to march, were provided for in the hospitals at
Memphis. We replenished our stock of rations so as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
to have a ten days' supply on hand, and busied ourselves
in preparations for the morrow's march till late
in the night, when we retired to rest, awaiting the expected
reveille at one o'clock.</p>

<p>The drums, however, did not beat till half past five,
and we awoke to learn that the march had been deferred
till 11 A.&nbsp;M. At half past eleven the regiment moved,
leading the column; the other regiments and the batteries
following in their appropriate order. As we passed
the Head Quarters of General Sherman, that officer sat
on his charger watching us with all the scrutiny of an
inspection. As we took a last look at him, we felt a
feeling of regret that he was to command us no longer;
but this was in a measure relieved by the thought that
our old division commander, whom in times past we
had been so happy and proud to follow, still led us.
But we had still another source of regret; for, as we
looked back upon the spires of Memphis, we could not
but think that for a season, at least, such days of
pleasant soldiering were over.</p>

<p>The road was free from dust on account of a heavy
rain which had fallen the previous day, but the heat was
oppressive in the extreme. Notwithstanding, in the
commencement of the march, strict orders had been
issued against straggling, we had scarcely got beyond
the suburbs of the city when men began to give out and
leave the ranks, and several were sun-struck and had
to be put in the ambulances. Although the General
took the precaution to halt and rest the column fifteen
minutes each hour, before night the way was lined with
men who were unable to keep up. We halted for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
night about eight miles to the northeast of Memphis,
on a deeply wooded bottom of Wolf River. Owing to
some obstruction which the wagons had met, a part of
our train was still some time after dark in getting up,
and it was not till late in the night that all the stragglers
rejoined their commands.</p>

<p>September 7. It was General Hurlbut's plan to
reverse each day the order of march so as to give no
preference of place in the column to any regiment or
battery. The 2d Brigade took the lead to-day, and
the 3d Iowa marched in the rear of the 1st Brigade,
and hence formed the rear guard of the column. Gen.
Hurlbut was an early riser, and he announced each
night the time of commencing the following day's
march, which was seldom later than four o'clock in the
morning.</p>

<p>This morning the troops began to move at an early
hour, and about eight o'clock the 3d Iowa joined in
with its train and was in motion. Owing to the light
showers of yesterday evening which had succeeded the
intense heat of the day, the air this morning was cool
with occasional breezes, and consequently the march
was less arduous, and the men kept the ranks without
much difficulty. We made no halt for dinner.</p>

<p>About 3 P.&nbsp;M. we saw a dense smoke rising in
advance, and on approaching discovered that it was a
house on fire, and that several soldiers were applying
the torch to other buildings near by. All that we could
learn of the cause of this operation was that a Confederate
flag, an Enfield rifle and a set of accoutrements
marked "O. V. M." had been found secreted in it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
This had suggested to those who made the discovery
that its inmates were traitors, and that it was a matter
of duty with them to commit the house and the surrounding
buildings to flames, which they were now doing
with the utmost <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sang froid</i>. General Hurlbut the next
day issued an order censuring this act in severe terms,
and warning his troops against similar conduct in
future.</p>

<p>About this time a shower of rain commenced falling,
cooling the atmosphere and rendering the roads quite
favorable to marching. As it began to grow dark, it
became evident from the frequent and annoying halts
of the train ahead of us, that the regiments and batteries
in the advance of the column were taking their positions
for the night. Indeed so slow was our march on account
of these halts, that our regiment did not reach its camping
ground before eleven o'clock, having accomplished
not more than two miles in the last four hours. This
was by far the most fatiguing part of the day's march.
Notwithstanding we had halted at sundown, dressed our
files, loaded our pieces and received the strictest orders
against straggling, it was impossible for the officers to
keep the men in ranks. Many straggled far ahead and
threw themselves down upon the green sward and went
to sleep, to be awakened by their comrades or the rear
guard. Reaching our position for the night, we ate a
hasty supper from our haversacks, and threw ourselves
down to sleep. Happy the lot of most of us compared
with that of the few, who, exhausted and foot-sore, were
yet compelled to watch on picket while we slept.</p>

<p>September 8. We rested in camp to-day. The wind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
was damp with a drizzling rain, which was most welcome
to us, as we expected to renew the march at an early
hour. The enemy's cavalry was said to be prowling
around us, and apprehensions were felt that a large
body of his troops were in the vicinity. We received
orders that there was to be no straggling from our stacks
of arms, and, to prevent this, to have roll call every
two hours. During the day we put up tents, and with
the aid of the fresh meat and vegetables we had procured
on the yesterday's march, we made ourselves
quite comfortable. Towards night we had a careful
inspection of arms and ammunition, and received the
usual marching orders for the morning.</p>

<p>September 9. The column moved at daylight and
continued the march all day without interruption or
seeing any indications of an enemy. We camped for
the night on a creek bottom, rank with growing timber
and abounding in grapes, muscadines, lizards, copperheads,
and the like.</p>

<p>September 10. Reveille woke us at 3 o'clock, and
an easy march brought us to the Muddy, a small stream
very appropriately named, and two miles beyond which
flows the Hatchie. We did not put up tents for the
night, and a heavy rain which fell towards morning
soaked our blankets and proved to be not as much of
a luxury as the previous ones had been.</p>

<p>September 11. The drums sounded at half past three.
The bridge over the Hatchie in advance of us had been
destroyed by a party of Federal cavalry who had passed
through the country early in the summer, disguised as
cotton burners, but had been detected and pursued.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
In order to advance, it became necessary to rebuild it.
For this purpose General Hurlbut ordered a pioneer
party of soldiers and contrabands to be detailed, and
the 3d Iowa and 41st Illinois to move forward to protect
them while at work. We accordingly moved at 5 A.&nbsp;M.
in light marching order, passed over a road leading
through a cane and cypress swamp, whose rotten and
dilapidated bridges indicated that it had not been used
in several years, and reached the river, where we stacked
arms and threw across a picket by means of a dug-out
which we found here. We passed a wet and cheerless
day, watching the pioneers who were busy felling trees,
carrying logs into the stream, and laying the foundations
of the proposed bridge. Without blankets and
almost without food, we were compelled to pass the night
here as we had passed the day.</p>

<p>While we thus lay beside our struggling fires, endeavoring
to sleep, it may be imagined that our reflections
were anything but pleasant. Why were we moving
so far to the north of Bolivar, and on such an extraordinary
road? Was it to evade, deceive, or surprise the
enemy? Had our forces indeed retreated from Bolivar,
or were the rebels making designs in their rear? Did
the country afford no better roads than this? Or, if it
was "strategy" to advance on such a road, would the
advantages counterbalance the delay in constructing
bridges? Rumor supplied twenty different solutions;
but the General, and perhaps a few others, alone knew
the correct one.</p>

<p>A party of cavalry arrived during the night from
Bolivar with such intelligence as changed matters entirely.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
The work on the bridge was abandoned, and
early in the morning, September 12, we returned to
camp and found the column already beginning to move.
Loading our wagons and without waiting to take breakfast,
we resumed our places in the order of march. The
day was cloudy and cool and the roads good. A steady
march of thirteen miles brought us to a wooded bottom,
where, out of a few pools, we procured a supply of muddy
water.</p>

<p>Monday, September 13. We moved early, and the
march was a hard one. We halted about two hours in
the middle of the day by the side of a mill pond, and
took a refreshing bath and a pleasant siesta. The
afternoon was very hot and the dust excessive. It
seemed that the rains, which had made the roads of
yesterday so excellent, had not reached this section.
But the men kept their ranks well, and before night we
went into camp in a beautiful situation on Spring Creek,
about two miles to the west of Bolivar. Here we rested
the following day, and on the 16th changed camp to a
high and pleasant locality across the creek. The regiments
of the division were somewhat separated, and the
batteries occupied the most commanding and defensible
position. The water was excellent; our supplies were
regular and abundant, and the country around abounded
in forage for our animals. The weather was delightful.
We were able to procure from the inhabitants many
luxuries. On the whole the people were quite friendly
toward us. They seemed to have settled down to the
conclusion that their country was to be permanently occupied
by Federals, and inclined to make the best of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
state of things they could not prevent. Our duty was
heavy; but Col. Trumbull endeavored to lighten it as
much as possible. Our foraging expeditions furnished
some excitement, and, notwithstanding very stringent
orders against plundering, generally kept us well supplied
with fresh vegetables and meat. Col. Trumbull was
an excellent drill master, and under him our regiment
improved rapidly in the evolutions of the battalion.</p>

<p>The 28th Illinois was camped nearest to us, and here
there grew up between the men of the 3d Iowa and of
that gallant regiment, a feeling of friendship which
nothing has since served to obliterate.</p>

<p>On the 19th of September, orders came to our regiment
to move the following morning at sunrise, taking
all our baggage. It was to be a reconnoissance in force
with a heavy train designed to deceive the enemy. The
force consisted of the 1st Brigade and two battalions of
the gallant 2d Illinois Cavalry, all under command of
Brig. Gen. Lauman. The column started shortly after
sunrise and took the road leading south toward Grand
Junction.</p>

<p>Officers and men were equally ignorant of the object
of the movement. We said it could not be a reconnoissance,
else we would not have taken our train. Nor
could it be that it was intended to occupy Grand Junction
with so small a force. But we <em>believed</em> in our
generals, and, inexplicable as the movement seemed, it
gave us no particular concern. The day being cool and
the roads good, we made a march of about eighteen
miles, but camped in a country destitute of water, save
what was to be found in a few pools, about five miles to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
the north of Grand Junction. The pickets were carefully
posted and the men ordered to sleep on their arms,
and every precaution was taken against surprise.</p>

<p>The march was resumed at daylight next morning,
and when we had proceeded to within a mile of Grand
Junction, the cavalry reported the enemy. Let us look
at the situation. LaGrange is four miles west of Grand
Junction. A road leading from that place to the north,
joins at Middleburg, about eight miles south of Bolivar,
the way on which we were now marching. On this road
the enemy was pushing a strong column past our right
flank and endeavoring to get in our rear. The cavalry
reported it to be a mile and a half in length. When
this word was brought to the General, he saw the danger
at a glance, and said with his usual brevity, "We must
get out of this." He dispatched messengers to General
Hurlbut. The wagons began to turn around. The 3d
Iowa countermarched, and then was halted and brought
to a front. Every one anticipated the next command,
and one or two began to feel of their cartridge boxes;
at sight of which Col. Trumbull called out, rebuking,
"Wait for the word!" He then gave the command,
"Load at will&mdash;load!" Soon the column was in motion
to the rear, and began to execute a retreat, such as, in
rapidity, order and success is seldom surpassed. Our
regiment, hitherto in advance, was now in the rear,
our battalion of cavalry moved past the column through
the fields and became the new advance guard, while the
other remained behind to cover the retreat. As this
battalion let down the fence and rode past us into the
field, the boys greeted each other with such shouts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
good natured raillery as told plainly that no one was
afraid. It soon became apparent that the enemy was
also following us in the rear. A gallant cavalry officer
with a few men lingered behind to reconnoiter until the
rebels were within hailing distance of him. They invited
him to come up and have a talk, but he declined, and
rode forward to tell General Lauman of what he had
seen. The General sent Beauregard, his chief of orderlies,
to hurry on the train. The old soldier realized as
much as the General himself, that we were in a crisis.
He went storming up and down the road, forbidding the
teamsters to lock going down the steepest hills, and
talking to some of them in such a manner as to secure
their lasting gratitude. The manner in which he discharged
this important duty excited the admiration of
all. The column took a road further to the east than
the one on which we had come, so as to make sure of
evading the enemy. As we passed through the little
town of Van Buren, the citizens came out to watch us,
and a grin of delight played on their countenances,
which made the boys gnash their teeth.</p>

<p>In three hours, with no loss but that of two horses, we
had retreated twelve miles. The day was quite warm,
and the dust began to rise heavily beneath our feet.
The ambulances and wagons were so full of exhausted
men that they could hold no more, and still they continued
to give out. We were fast reaching the limit of
endurance. General Lauman observing this, and at
length reaching a tract of high open fields, he began to
wink ominously, "I'll fight them right here," said he,
"my men would sooner fight than run at any odds."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
The next moment we saw the fences tumbling down, and
Mann's Battery, a section on each side of the road, was
quickly in position. The infantry was formed in two
lines, two regiments on each side of the road. The
3d Iowa was on the right of it in the front line, and
supported a section of the guns. Behind us, perhaps a
half mile, the waters of Spring Creek flowed clear and
cool, and here the animals and exhausted men having
got water, the train proceeded leisurely on out of the
way. A captain of cavalry, with six men, went back
to reconnoiter. Colonel Trumbull also rode leisurely
back alone over the field. The party met the enemy's
cavalry, and were pursued by them. As the rebels
came in sight, kicking up a great cloud of dust, the two
pieces on the right of the road opened with shell upon
them, and a few discharges caused them hastily to disappear.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the two regiments of the second line had
moved to the rear, crossed the creek, and proceeded to
form a new line faced to the south, on a commanding
field about three miles to the north. The enemy making
no further demonstrations, the two remaining regiments
and the battery, after a time, formed column and
passed through this new line about dusk, and soon after
met reinforcements, three regiments and a battery under
General Hurlbut. Moving leisurely back, we reached
our former camping places about 8 P.&nbsp;M.</p>

<p>But apprehensions of an early attack were entertained.
In pursuance of orders received from General
Hurlbut during the night, we were in line and had our
wagons loaded at 3 o'clock next morning, and waited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
most of the day, expecting the approach of the enemy.
We however policed our camps, and toward night put
up our tents. Reinforcements were started to us from
Jackson, and that evening we had a dress parade at
which an order from General Hurlbut was read, stating
that with reinforcements that had arrived and were
about to arrive, he hoped soon to be able to assume
the offensive; also that reveille would beat at 2 o'clock
next morning, and that the baggage would be loaded
at four. The order was obeyed; but the enemy declined
battle and the General did not pursue. We again put
up our tents; but at night a similar order compelled us
to take them down again early in the morning. And
thus for several days we were kept in a constant state
of vigilance and of preparation for any emergency.</p>

<p>The troops now here in excess of the 4th Division
constituted an additional division under Brig. Gen.
Ross.</p>

<p>Our regiment was on battalion drill on the afternoon
of October 3d, when orders came to be ready to march
promptly at three o'clock in the morning, with three
days cooked rations in haversacks. The evening was
spent in preparation, and during the night frequent
orders arrived announcing the details of the march.
We were to go in light order, taking, besides the ambulances,
but two wagons to the regiment, one for ammunition
and one for tents, of which each company was to
take one. Those not able to march were exempted
by the surgeons, and for this purpose an examination
was had.</p>

<p>Reveille roused us at one o'clock; at two we had
breakfasted; and at three the column formed on the
open fields to the west of Bolivar. It consisted of the
4th Division, and the 68th Ohio and 12th Michigan of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
Ross' division. General Hurlbut was in command.
General Ross was to remain to guard the place.</p>

<p>The column began to move without delay. We
passed through Bolivar and took the road leading in a
southeast direction toward Corinth. The full moon
shone beautifully, but not enough to light the densely
wooded bottom through which for two miles beyond
Bolivar the road defiles. Besides the frequent mudholes,
we had to ford a small creek that flows through
a cypress swamp, by which means the ranks were much
broken and the column greatly lengthened. When the
head of the column gained the bluffs to the east of this,
it was halted to wait for the rear to come up. Day had
not yet dawned, but the scene was enchanting. The
moon cast a pure pale light over all the landscape,
which for a long distance lay beneath us to the west.
There was not a breath of air in motion; and the profound
silence which pervaded all nature was broken
only by the heavy tread of man and horse, and the
clatter of baggage and artillery wheels. Where and
why were we thus marching? The sudden orders, the
nature of the preparations, and the unexpected direction
we were taking, assured us that it was an uncommon
movement, and that there was trouble ahead. All
was mystery; but in it every one could see a battle.
Little did we think that at that very hour the enemy was
preparing to storm our works at Corinth.</p>

<p>As soon as the rear battalions had crossed the stream
the march was resumed with energy. The roads were
not dusty, and when the day dawned there arose a cool
breeze, which enabled us to maintain the same speed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
with which we had led out. Fifteen miles brought us
by 11 A.&nbsp;M. to a small stream where we halted till
2 P.&nbsp;M., for dinner and rest.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the roads were somewhat dustier.
At Pocahontas Station we crossed the Memphis and
Charleston Railroad, and, soon after, the cavalry, two
battalions of the 5th Ohio, came upon a picket of the
enemy which they put to flight, losing one man mortally
wounded. The column went into camp for the night
on the Big Muddy, the 1st Brigade beyond it, the 2d
behind it. The Third Iowa occupied precisely the same
ground on which it had camped the night of the 13th
of June.</p>

<p>The 1st Brigade had just stacked arms, when word
came that our cavalry had engaged that of the enemy
about a mile and a half to the front, and that they were
fighting sharply. Listening, we could hear the indistinct
crack of the carbines. Messengers began and
continued to arrive from the scene of action; but it was
some time before General Lauman seemed much concerned
about it. At length we saw an officer ride up
excitedly to him. Then the general climbed his horse,
and galloping down to our regiment, cried out: "Third
Iowa! in line!" We sprang to our stacks and took
arms; when he commanded in the same tone: "At
will&mdash;load!" While we thus stood in line, expecting
every moment to see the cavalry breaking back upon
us, we saw something in the east, flashing back the
rays of the setting sun. It approached us, dancing
through the bushes like two great wheels of fire, and
soon discovered itself, an enormous pair of spectacles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
behind which a cavalry officer came riding frantically
up, and with a strange accent cried to Captain
Trumbull: "Kapn-ve-kot-ateenuntert-kafalrie-kiust-uns-atwo-richiments-ot-ve-to-peet-a-retreat?"
The Colonel very coolly referred him to the General, when
he rode off, saying the General knew all about it.</p>

<p>After about an hour's fighting, the contending parties
withdrew as if by mutual consent, and our cavalry as
per orders retired upon the infantry. We again stacked
arms, and nothing occurred during the night to prevent
us from sleeping soundly.</p>

<p>About 3 o'clock in the morning, Major General Ord
arrived from Corinth, whence he had come by way of
Jackson and Bolivar, from the latter place on horseback,
escorted by a company of the 2d Illinois Cavalry. He
assumed command of all the forces, and approved the
plan of battle General Hurlbut had already made.
He brought intelligence that the rebels had been defeated
at Corinth, and were retreating towards us.
Early in the morning, and about the time we heard
of his arrival, this news circulated through our fires
merely in the shape of a vague rumor of a battle at
Corinth.</p>

<p>We were aroused at daylight, and ordered to eat our
breakfasts and get ready to move. The cavalry pickets,
stationed at a house, fell back into the edge of a wood
to eat their breakfast without molestation, and when
they attempted to return to their former post, found the
house occupied by rebels, and were unable to dislodge
them. About seven o'clock, the 25th Indiana, of
Veatch's Brigade, moved past us to the front, followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
by a battery, and their brigade train. The wagons
were parked with our's on the field on which the
1st Brigade still rested. It was not long before we
heard the firing of skirmishers, and soon after, we were
startled by discharges of artillery rapid and near. It
was a section of Bolton's Battery shelling the enemy
out of the house. Soon the remainder of Gen. Veatch's
command moved past us, the 28th Illinois followed, and
Generals Ord and Hurlbut, followed by the body-guard
of the former, rode leisurely to the front. General
Hurlbut was in full uniform, but General Ord wore a
yellow linen coat.</p>

<p>About this time, and still further to the east, we
could hear a skirmishing fire, now deepening into heavy
volleys, and now slackening into occasional discharges.
Suddenly began the noise of artillery, deep and loud,
and for a long time we stood by our stacks of arms,
and listened with great interest to the mingled sounds
of both arms. Orderlies and staff officers rode to and
from the field, but from them we could gather little
news of the progress of the battle. But it was all in
our favor. The enemy was being driven at all points.
Retreating from Corinth and encountering our cavalry
the previous night, which after the skirmish had retreated
from him, he thought we were merely a cavalry
force sent out to watch him, or to harass him in the
rear, while attacking Corinth. He did not expect a
heavy force was moving to attack him in the rear. He
was not looking for such generalship on the part of
Grant. Nor, when at the block house, he had seen
Bolton's artillery and Morgan's skirmishers, was he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
willing to give up the delusion which General Hurlbut
had so skillfully prepared for him; but with great boldness
he pushed a heavy column of his troops across the
bridge of the Hatchie, when, to his amazement, he saw
General Veatch's infantry deploying before him, and
his batteries taking possession of Matamora heights.
The enemy quickly got his guns in battery, and his
infantry deployed to the right and left. Then a severe
artillery duel, and then the skirmishers again joined,
and the 2d Brigade advanced at a charging step. The
enemy withered before their fire, and finally fled before
their approaching bayonets. The charge was gallantly
pressed. Most of the rebels rushed, panic stricken,
over the bridge; many threw away their guns and
plunged through the river; some fled through the woods
to the right, and escaped by crossing on logs above
the bridge; and about four hundred surrendered on
the west bank. A fine four gun battery was also
captured.</p>

<p>To second these movements, General Lauman had
sent forward the 28th and 53d Illinois regiments of his
brigade; the 41st was detailed to guard the wagon
train, and the 32d and 3d Iowa were in reserve. As
soon as General Veatch's battalion commenced, General
Lauman moved forward with these two reserve regiments
about two miles, and deployed us, the 32d on the
right, the 3d Iowa on the left of the road, about a half
mile in the rear of Matamora heights, from which we
saw the 2d Brigade move forward to the attack, and
heard the noise of the battle. It was to us an hour
of hope and fear. The appearance of the three generals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
Ord, Hurlbut and Lauman, as they now sat in the road
on their horses in advance of us, and received messengers
and dispatched orders, and calmly conversed with
each other, tended to give us confidence. But we had
seen enough of battle to know that its fortunes defy
calculation; we knew nothing of the strength of the
enemy, and could not but think, that gallantly as they
had advanced to the attack, our comrades might be
driven back in dismay, and we compelled to interpose
between them and a victorious foe.</p>

<p>The generals soon rode forward and found the enemy
driven across the river. General Ord ordered Veatch
to throw his regiments across and deploy them successively
to the right and left of the road. Beyond the
river there was about twelve rods of bottom, and then
there arose a very high and steep bluff. Along the
brow of this the enemy, rallying and reinforced, had
formed new lines of battle, and planted artillery which
from different points, enfiladed the road and bridge,
and swept the field on both sides of the stream. Following
up the river, just above the bridge it makes an
abrupt elbow and comes down from the east running
parallel to the road on the opposite side. In this elbow
and on not more than half an acre of ground, a part
of General Veatch's brigade, according to the orders
of General Ord, would have to deploy. The 53d Indiana
crossed first, and, endeavoring to form on this ground,
became crowded together in the narrow space between
the road and the river, when it met a plunging fire
of musketry and canister, and was driven back to the
bridge in disorder and with great loss. Here they met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
the 25th Indiana, which crossed bravely and stayed
them in their retreat. The 14th and 15th Illinois followed
handsomely and deployed to the left of the road.
Then crossed the 28th and 53d Illinois of Lauman's
brigade, which were ordered to deploy to the right,
where, like the 52d Indiana, they were crowded together
and confused; but they held their ground and bravely
returned the fire of the enemy.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the reserves were ordered to the front.
General Lauman took the lead, and we advanced by
the flank rapidly down the road. We crossed the ridge
and came to the village. Beyond us the field was swept
by a converging fire of the enemy's batteries. Into
this storm of shot, shell and canister, we ran. Beyond
the river the battle was at its hight. Its noise was
one uninterrupted roar. We knew that our troops were
sustaining it bravely; for we met no stragglers as at
Shiloh. The bridge was swept by a random fire directed
through the tops of the trees. Colonel Trumbull ordered
us to fix bayonets. We crossed the bridge on the run,
and fixed bayonets, crossing. Beyond the bridge sat
General Lauman and staff. Beauregard, the old orderly,
was wounded and bleeding freely at the mouth; but he
still was able to respond to our cheers, and to call upon
us to "give the rebels hell." Colonel Trumbull riding
in lead, pointed to the hill and ordered us to charge.
The regiment obeyed bravely and had nearly reached
the foot of the hill, when it was ordered to file to the
right. Here in a moment we became massed and mingled
with the regiments which had endeavored to form
here before us. Through the dense smoke we could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
not see the enemy; but we could hear the rapid jar
of his artillery before and above us, and his canister as
it swept through the air in vollies, making inroads into
the masses that swayed to and fro around us. The
situation was disastrous in the extreme. We were
massed and crowded together, and completely at the
mercy of the enemy's fire, while we could scarcely hope
to injure him with our's. Behind us an almost impassable
barrier, obstructing retreat. To attempt to withdraw
across the narrow bridge would have insured our
destruction. What then were we to do? We could not
advance, we could not retreat, nor could we effectively
return the enemy's fire. The next moment the enemy's
masses might pour down the hill at a charge. We must
hold our ground like men, and, if necessary, die here.
This terrible resolution seemed to have seized all
hearts.</p>

<p>At this juncture General Ord was wounded, and the
command devolved upon General Hurlbut, to whom it
of right belonged. The day was now lost, and it was
for him to regain it. It was for him to correct the
fatal dispositions of the former, to make new dispositions
of the troops under that appalling fire, and out
of shattered and broken elements to organize victory.
He rode across the bridge and into the thickest of the
fire. He ordered the 46th Illinois, and the 68th Ohio,
and 12th Michigan, yet on the west bank, to cross the
bridge, and deploy to the left so as to flank the hill.
They executed the movement finely, and in a few
moments the enemy saw, with astonishment, regiments
emerging from the field of his concentrated fire, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
he had held us so long, and advancing in good order upon
his right. His firing suddenly ceased; his colors disappeared
from the crest of the hill. He saw his victory
snatched from him by superior skill and courage, and
fled in dismay.</p>

<p>At this juncture, having quickly formed our regiment,
Colonel Trumbull took off his hat and said to us, "Men
of the Third Iowa, will you stand by me this day?"
All voices responded, "We will!" "Then," replied he,
"here's a man that never retreats this day!" Could we
have asked for a better leader?</p>

<p>In a few moments the whole force, splendidly aligned,
advanced up the hill, and new lines were formed on its
crest. The artillery followed, Mann's battery in lead,
the planting of which General Hurlbut superintended in
person. This battery, which won such honors at Shiloh,
now behaved, if possible, more admirably than before.
Leaving their caissons and limbers under the crest of
the hill, the men ran their guns up by hand and opened
a fire upon the enemy's masked battery, directing their
aim at its smoke. The other batteries took position
to its left, one of them so as to command the enemy's
battery with a flanking fire. The practice of our artillery
was splendid. As often as one of the enemy's
guns would fire, three or four of ours would reply.
Meantime a party of volunteer skirmishers from the
15th Illinois, crept up behind the crest of a hill in
the open field, between the left of our line and
the enemy, and with the most amusing impudence,
picked off his wheel horses and cannoneers. In a
short time his battery was knocked to pieces and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
compelled to leave the field. His rear guard then withdrew,
and disappeared from our front. The firing
of our cannon had scarcely ceased, when we heard those
of Rosecrans in the direction of Corinth, thundering in
the enemy's rear. This should have been sufficient to
determine the general to press the pursuit. Why this
was not done was an enigma to us then, and it has
remained unexplained ever since. It is true, we were
not prepared for a general pursuit. But the enemy
twice beaten was between two victorious armies, and
had but one avenue of escape to the south, and that
over a single bridge, where a portion of his force might
have been cut off. But though the enemy's situation
was not realized then, and though, with the knowledge
he had, the general followed the best counsels in resting
on the field, it is not doubted now that the enemy's
retreat might have been pressed till night with splendid
results.</p>

<p>We rested in line of battle till nearly night, when the
wagons came up and we bivouacked on the field. The
battle had lasted seven hours, beginning before eight
in the morning, and ending before three in the afternoon.
We were fatigued, not so much from the day's
fighting as from the hard march of yesterday. A victory
is for a time a great equalizer of military caste. It
obliterates the distinctions of rank; the officer does not
feel above the soldier, and the soldier feels as good as
the officer; all become comrades in the general rejoicing.
It is hard then for the soldier to disobey the
officer; it is likewise hard for the officer to chide the
soldier. And when to-night squads of the boys went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
to the nearest farm houses, and came back with back
loads of fresh meat, the officers,&mdash;the general himself,
could not utter a word of disapproval.</p>

<p>That night three companies of the Third Iowa, A,
F and H, were detailed for picket. Our position was
a half mile in advance of the bluffs, and near where the
enemy had formed his last lines of battle. Before us
lay an open valley which looked strangely beautiful in
the light of the moon. Behind us were scattered
through the woods the enemy's dead. Our own were
yet unburied. The moon as it looked down seemed to
be pitying the fate of the brave men that lay staring a
death-stare at her serene countenance. The "dim-lit
fields" and the shadowy woods surrounding them,
possessed a weird appearance, as though the ghosts
of the slain heroes were flitting over them. And as we
listened to the distant barking of the wakeful dog, and
to the moanings of the night owl, we heard, or thought
we heard, the far off sounds of the enemy's retreating
hosts. And there we watched while our comrades
slept. Terrible battle! glorious victory! moonlight
watching on a field of death!&mdash;what scenes for future
recollection!</p>

<p>Early in the morning, the 41st Illinois with two
howitzers of Mann's battery, went forward to reconnoiter.
They met the army of Rosecrans in pursuit
of the enemy, who had retreated to the south, crossing
the Hatchie six miles above us, and thus made good
his escape. The line of the enemy's retreat was strown
with abandoned baggage, wagons and artillery. A large
detail under a commissioned officer went forward to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
burn them. Many squads of stragglers came in, exhausted,
sick, disheartened, and telling doleful stories
of their sufferings. The day was spent in burying the
dead, caring for the wounded and collecting the arms
scattered over the field, abandoned by the enemy in
his retreat.</p>

<p>Our rations were exhausted, but the country supplied
us abundantly. On the morning of the 7th, wagons
arrived with rations from Bolivar, and we replenished
our haversacks and began our return march. We had
not proceeded far before we met another train of wagons
coming to take away such of the wounded as had not
yet been removed. It was a matter of much regret to
us, as we turned our backs to our field of glory, that we
had not joined Rosecrans in the pursuit. But we were
retiring victorious, and save the thoughts of our dead
and wounded comrades, little served to diminish our joy.
We halted for the night on the creek where we had taken
dinner on Saturday, and the next day at eleven o'clock
we reached our camp.</p>

<p>Before dismissing the battalion, Colonel Trumbull
addressed us, saying that General Lauman had complimented
our good conduct in the battle, and that if our
Generals were proud of us, we had equal reason to be
proud of our Generals. He therefore proposed three
cheers successively for Generals Ord, Hurlbut, Lauman,
and Veatch, which were given with a will, and three were
then spontaneously given for Colonel Trumbull.</p>

<p>The next day Colonel Trumbull ordered the officers
of the regiment, who had commanded companies in the
battle, to make out official reports, stating who, if any,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
had behaved in a manner particularly meritorious, and
who, if any, had been guilty of misconduct. Under the
latter head, a few were reported, whom the Colonel
promptly arrested and confined, and reported to brigade
headquarters with the request that they be court-martialed
and punished.</p>

<p>Our loss in the whole force engaged did not fall far
short of six hundred in killed and wounded. Our regiment
lost two killed and about sixty wounded. The
enemy's loss in killed and wounded must have been
much less than ours. He did not leave many in the
field. According to the most moderate reports, the
captures were two batteries, including fourteen caissons,
four hundred prisoners, one thousand stand of small
arms, and about seventy wagons, burned the next day
on the line of his retreat.</p>

Hurlbut's parting review&mdash;His parting orders&mdash;How
they were received&mdash;Congratulatory orders of General

<p>The following is Colonel Trumbull's official report
of the part taken by the 3d Iowa in the battle of Matamora.
I give it as it was furnished me from regimental
head quarters. With all due deference to the Colonel,
who commanded us so bravely, and who had a better
opportunity of knowing our situation during the battle
than any one man among us, I think all will agree with
me that in some statements he has made slight mistakes.
It was not so much the enemy's fire, though that was
severe, that threw us into confusion beyond the bridge,
as it was the attempt to form us in line to the right
of the road, on the narrow space already crowded by
broken troops. We were first ordered to charge, and
then, by General Lauman, I believe, <i>to file to the right</i>,
the general not wishing to advance us into the fire of
our own troops, who in the tumult could not hear the
order to cease firing. The Colonel does not mention
that, before any attempt to re-form the regiment was
successful, the enemy had ceased firing and retired from
the crest of the hill. This was due to the manner in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
which General Hurlbut had disposed on the left his yet
available troops. The promptness with which the regiment
again formed was due to the Colonel as much as
to the men. When once all could hear and understand
the voice of the commander, who through the trying
storm they had seen behaving so bravely, nothing more
was needed to bring them to their places in ranks:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right break-before">
<span class="smcap">Head Quarters, 3d Iowa Infantry Camp,}<br />

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt. H. Schofield</span>, A. A. G.&mdash;<i>Sir</i>: I have the
honor to report the part taken by the 3d Iowa Infantry
in the battle of the 5th of October. The 3d Iowa, 300
strong, was on the right of the 1st Brigade, (Gen. Lauman),
and formed part of the reserve. When the
reserve was ordered into action the 3d Iowa led, crossing
the bridge at a cheer, and at a double quick, under
so severe a fire that about &mdash;&mdash; men were shot down
in a few minutes, including over half of the commissioned
officers present. This necessarily threw the regiment
into some confusion, especially as the road was narrow
and encumbered with a good deal of underbrush, and
the men pressing forward got entangled with the men
of other regiments. I saw no way to extricate the
regiment, but by planting the colors in the middle of the
road, and ordering the men to rally to them. This was
promptly done, nearly every man springing instantly
to his place. The regiment then moved forward up
the hill in company with other regiments which had
adopted the same plan, the enemy retiring as we
advanced. On reaching the summit, the 3d Iowa was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
stationed in the open plain to the left of the road, and
toward the close of the engagement was moved to the
right of the road near the bend of the river to support
the gallant 28th Illinois, (Col. Johnson). The battle
was now about over.</p>

<p>I have to regret the loss of 1st Lieut. W. P. Dodd,
commanding Company H., who was struck by a shell
and instantly killed, just before we crossed the bridge.
He was a brave and faithful officer, and his loss will fall
heavily upon the regiment. I have also to regret the
permanent disability of Capt. E. J. Weiser, of Company
D, and acting 2d Lieut. D. W. Foote, of Company I,
two noble and gallant officers, both of whom have been
wounded in battle before. Capt. C. Kostman, commanding
Company C, and Lieut. W. B. Hamil, commanding
Company K, were both severely wounded
while gallantly pressing forward in the front of their
respective companies. 2d Lieut. C. E. Anderson, commanding
Company G, who had done his whole duty
through the engagement, was severely wounded just at
the close of the battle. 1st Lieut. J. G. Scoby was
especially prominent in rallying the men to the colors.
Lieut. Geary, Company H, deserves especial mention,
for staying in command of his company after the
death of the 1st Lieutenant, all through the battle, and
until we reached Bolivar, though suffering from a painful,
but not a severe wound. Lieutenants McMurtry
and Burdick, of Company D, Lakin and Abernethy, of
Company F, and Moe, of Company C, did their duty
bravely and well. Company A. was not engaged. 2d
Lieutenant G. H. Cushman, acting adjutant, and Sergeant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
Major, A. W. Montague, both displayed great
coolness and courage, and rendered me valuable assistance
on the field.</p>

<p>The conduct of the rank and file in crossing the
bridge, under the terrific fire of the enemy's batteries,
and in rallying to the flag as promptly as they did,
deserves the highest praise. Several cases of individual
bravery among the men, I shall bring to the notice
of the General commanding the Brigade, as soon as I
have fully investigated the circumstances. I take
pleasure in noticing here the gallantry of Corporal
Anderson Edwards, the color bearer. This is the third
fight in which he has carried the colors of the regiment,
and he deserves the notice of the General commanding.
I am ashamed to say that a few&mdash;a very few cases of
misconduct in the presence of the enemy have been reported
to me, which on further investigation I shall submit to
the General commanding the Brigade, with a request
that they may be submitted to a general court martial.</p>

<p>I herewith enclose a list of the killed and wounded
of the Iowa Third in the action of the 5th. The number
of the killed is very small, considering the terrible
character of the wounds received.</p>

<p>
I have the honor to be, sir,<br />
<span class="in2">With great respect,</span><br />
<span class="in4">Your obedient servant,</span><br />

</p></blockquote>

<p>No one can deny the justness and impartiality with
which this report reviews the conduct of the officers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
men. It is to be regretted, however, that more instances
of gallant conduct on the part of the latter, of
which there were many, could not have been brought to
light in this document.</p>

<p>Nothing more can be said of the conduct of General
Hurlbut, than that his praise was again upon the lips of
every man of the 4th Division. It received at the hands
of the Government the prompt recognition it deserved.
He was appointed to be a Major General and assigned
to the command of the District of Jackson. He took
a parting review of the decimated regiments which had
marched so long and fought so well under his command.
It was not like Napoleon taking leave of his officers at
Fontainebleu, nor Washington's farewell to the army
at New York; but it was a parting, where, on both sides,
there were far more regrets than would seem. As the
thinned battalions marched past him, their battered flags
saluting, with so many brave, familiar faces absent, the
General gazed upon his men, and the men turned their
eyes toward their general, with an affection which it
does not seem possible could have grown up between
soldier and commander in the short space of seven
months. On turning over the command of the Division
to General Lauman, General Hurlbut issued the following
farewell address:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right break-before">
<span class="smcap">Head Quarters Fourth Division,}<br />
District of West Tennessee,   }<br />
Bolivar</span>, Tenn., Oct. 8, 1862. }</p>

</p>

<p><i>Officers and Soldiers of the Fourth Division</i>:&mdash;Comrades
in battle, partakers of the weary march and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
long watches! By your discipline and courage the
victory has been won, and the title of the "Fighting
Fourth," earned at Shiloh, has been burnished with
additional splendor on the Hatchie.</p>

<p>We were ordered on a forlorn hope to the aid of our
beleaguered brothers in arms at Corinth. The march
was arduous, the undertaking desperate. My orders
were to reach Rosecrans at all hazards, and relieve him
or perish.</p>

<p>By the blessing of the God of our fathers and our
country, the forces which assailed that indomitable garrison
were scattered and broken by their invincible
courage before our turn came. But there was yet
work for the "Old Fourth."</p>

<p>The heavy mass of the enemy were retreating by the
State Line road, when, after crossing the Muddy, we
met them. Each arm of this division gallantly co-operating
with the other&mdash;cavalry, infantry and artillery,
over a rough and dangerous country&mdash;over hill
and through ravines, forest and thicket&mdash;a desperate
enemy made no breach in the serried ranks of this
command. Aided by your brave comrades of the 68th
Ohio and 12th Michigan, from General Ross' command,
field after field was swept, position after position seized
and occupied, until the crowning struggle of the day
came for the occupation of the high grounds east of the
Hatchie. The bridge across that stream was carried at
a charging step; the work of the artillery was done&mdash;that
of the infantry commenced in deadly earnest.
Major General Ord, a stranger to you, but to whom the
division, by its well won reputation, was no stranger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
and who had hitherto led the advance, was struck at
the bridge and disabled; the command then devolved
upon your old commander.</p>

<p>By misapprehension of the nature of the country
across the Hatchie, a large portion of the division had
been massed on impracticable ground to the right of the
road, and exposed to a terrific fire of canister at short
range. That you bore it without the possibility of
active return speaks well for your discipline.</p>

<p>Knowing the ground, I immediately determined to
throw out the main force to the left, crown the hill
side, and flank the enemy; and it is among the proudest
moments of my life, when I remember how promptly
the several regiments disengaged themselves from their
temporary confusion and extended to the left; and with
what a will they bent themselves to conquer the hill.
In twenty minutes all was over&mdash;the crest was gained
and held, the artillery rapidly in place, and the field of
Matamora was won. The broken fragments of the
Confederate army recoiled before your solid advance;
their main line of retreat was cut off, and their troops
forced over the broken ground east of the Hatchie.</p>

<p>Our duty was accomplished. Our wounded, the
bloody witnesses to the desperation of the fight, were
to be cared for. Already the victorious column of
Rosecrans was thundering in their rear. It was my
duty to bring in the forces that remained to me.</p>

<p>You have returned to camp. No colors lost; not a
man or a gun missing. It is a triumph; and you, and
I for you, have a right to be proud.</p>

<p>With you in this achievement were associated the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
Sixty-eighth Ohio and the Twelfth Michigan regiments.
They were worthy to be with you, and their conduct
receives the praise of their commanding officer.</p>

<p>And now the necessities of the service remove me
from the immediate command of the Fourth Division.
A promotion won by your courage and discipline
removes me to a larger command.</p>

<p>I wish you to understand from these, my parting
orders, that I know full well that no regiment in my
old division desired to be under my command when
we met at Donelson. The reason why, I know
well, but care not to tell now. Your respect I
conquered at Shiloh; your regard I hope to have
acquired since.</p>

<p>Give to the officer who may succeed me the same
prompt obedience, the same steady devotion to duty,
and you will make me, wherever I am, proud of the
high reputation of the Fourth Division.</p>

<p>Remember, every man and officer, that I here again
publicly acknowledge, that whatever I may have of
military reputation has been won by you; and that I
wear it only as coming from you; and that any misconduct
or want of discipline on your part, will grieve your
old commander. Remember that I place my honor as
well as your own in your hands, and that if I find a
difficult place that must be held, I shall call for the
Fourth. I have no fears how you will answer.</p>

<p>Our dead&mdash;our glorious dead! The joy of victory
is dimmed when we think of them. But they have died
as they would wish&mdash;died in defense of the Union and
the Laws&mdash;died bravely on the red field of battle, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
their unconquered banner over them. Their comrades
will avenge them.</p>

<p>And when at last our victorious flag shall float over
the national domain, reconquered and united, and the
weary soldier shall forget his toils in the endearments
of home, around your firesides and among your children
and neighbors, you shall recite as a part of your glorious
history, how you swept the rebel hosts, with every
advantage of position, across the Hatchie, and around
the opposing hill, with a wall of fire and steel that
repelled the chosen troops of Van Dorn and Price.
Infantry, artillery and cavalry of the Fourth Division,
and your well-deserving companions of the 68th Ohio
and 12th Michigan, you have done your duty, each in
his place, and each at the right time. You have satisfied
your General; and the country in due time shall
know what is due to each of you. I bid you, for a
while, farewell.</p>

<p>Officers and men, continue to deserve your lofty
reputation; and then, as heretofore you will continue to
receive the approbation of your General and strengthen
his hands in the performance of his duties.</p>

<p>This address was eagerly sought for, and read with
the greatest pride and delight by all the soldiers of the
Division. Every copy that could be supplied was taken
and preserved as a choice memento, or sent home to
friends. The boys read and re-read it so often that some
even had it committed to memory. Neither in it nor
in its author could any one see a blemish. Well, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
could blame us for rejoicing in our splendid victory,
and in our idol and ideal general? If our comrades of
other corps could not see it as we did, surely they should
have been willing to allow us to believe that there was
no division like the "Fighting Fourth," and no general
like "Old Steve." To them the order may have seemed
too eloquent&mdash;too boastful, and we, in the excess of our
delight over it, making a ridiculous display of vain conceit.
But was not the theme an eloquent one?&mdash;and
who had a better right to boast than <em>our</em> general, and
who to be proud than <em>we</em>?</p>

<p>General Grant viewed these battles at a distance,
though he controlled the general movements. His
order of thanks was more temperate, and perhaps more
appropriate. It read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right break-before">
<span class="smcap">Head Quarters, District of West Tennessee, }<br />
Jackson</span>, Tenn., October 7th, 1862. }</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">General Orders,<br />
<span class="in2">No. 88.</span></span><br />
</p>

<p>It is with heartfelt gratitude that the General commanding
congratulates the armies of the West for another
great victory won by them on the 3d, 4th, and
5th instant over the combined forces of Van Dorn
and Lovell.</p>

<p>The enemy chose his own time and place of making
the attack, and knowing the troops of the West as he
does, never would have made the attack, except with a
superior force, numerically. But for the undaunted
bravery of officers and soldiers, who have yet to learn
defeat, the efforts of the enemy would have been successful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p>Whilst one division of the army under Major General
Rosecrans was resisting and repelling the onslaught of
the enemy at Corinth, another from Bolivar under
Major General Hurlbut, was marching upon the enemy's
rear, driving in his pickets and cavalry, and
attracting the attention of a large force of infantry and
artillery. On the following day, under Major General
Ord, these forces advanced with unsurpassed gallantry,
driving the enemy back across the Hatchie, over ground
where it is almost incredible that a superior force should
be driven by an inferior, capturing two batteries (eight
guns), many hundred small arms, and several hundred
prisoners. To these two divisions of the army
all praise is due, and will be awarded by a grateful
country.</p>

<p>Between them there should be, and I trust there is,
the warmest bonds of brotherhood. Each was risking

<p>Brigadier Gen. Lauman assumed command of the
4th Division, and Colonel Pugh again took command
of the 1st Brigade, which he had commanded so well in
the battle of Shiloh. Major General McPherson was
put in command of the 2d Division of the District of
Jackson,&mdash;embracing the country around Bolivar held
by the 4th Division and the troops of General Ross, the
previous command of General Hurlbut and still included
in his command,&mdash;with his headquarters at
Bolivar.</p>

<p>On the 9th of October, General Ross went out to
reconnoiter in the direction of Ripley, but returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
without meeting anything of consequence. We again
relapsed into the quiet of camp life, and began our customary
drills and reviews. Our wounded were cared
for in the hospitals at Bolivar, but as fast as they were
able to be moved, were sent to Jackson and further
north. The prisoners taken in the late battle were sent
under escort of the 28th Illinois to Holly Springs, and
delivered over to be exchanged.</p>

<p>While at this camp we witnessed among ourselves
the novel experiment of soldiers being allowed to vote
on matters which pertain to their State, and to their
several communities at home. The commissioner appointed,
in pursuance of the act of the Legislature, to
take the vote of our regiment, P. F. Crane, Esq., of
Fayette county, arrived several days before that of the
election, and much of the time during his stay with us
enjoyed the hearty but rough hospitalities of Company
F. No military duty interfering, the election was held
on the usual day for the State, the 14th of the month.
That morning the <i>minors</i> were sent on picket to give
all the legal voters a chance. The polls were opened at
the Adjutant's tent. The whole affair passed off with
a marvelous degree of quiet and order. There was no
drunkenness, no wire-pulling, no trickery, no coercion,
no undue persuasion. If some of our fellow citizens at
home could have witnessed the election, characterized
by not a single disgraceful scene, but where every man,
like a citizen sovereign, voted unquestioned the ticket
of his choice, they would have been put to shame at the
disgraceful conduct which marks many elections held
amid the restraining influences of society and civilization.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
And could they have seen it, how it would have put to
shame (if aught could put to shame), the detested, corrupt,
traitorous and cowardly crew, who advocated the
withholding of this just and simple right from the men
who, they would allege, had forfeited it, because they
had placed themselves a voluntary living wall between
them and their country's foes! No event ever did more
honor to the patriotism and wisdom of a legislative
body, than did these elections to the Legislature of Iowa.
Most of those who had hitherto voted or sympathized
with the Democratic party, viewing its present workings
as tending more to embarrass the Government than to
reform its abuses, the vote for its candidates was very
light&mdash;less than forty out of about three hundred votes
cast. (I write from memory and can not give the official
figures.) And what was still more significant, Mahoney,
the traitor, only got two votes!</p>

<p>When the results of the Northern elections became
known, it cast a gloom over the great majority of our
regiment, and of the regiments around us. A crushing
defeat of our main armies would not have had so chilling
an effect on the <i>morale</i> of our best troops as this.
Waiving all consideration of the questions involved, it
was too plain to all that these elections indicated a
dissatisfaction with the administration, an opposition to
the prosecution of the war, a sympathy with the common
enemy, and in general, a disaffection among the people,
where all should be struggling unitedly for the salvation
of the Republic. Though many good and patriotic
men acted with the party, we could not but see that,
with scarcely an exception, every traitor in the North<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
likewise acted with it, and we heard with mortification
and rage the exultations of the enemy, who proclaimed
its triumph as a triumph of their cause among us. But
the most alarming feature of this indication of disaffection
to the Government was, that it took place at a time
when the two main armies of the enemy were scarcely
checked in their marches of victory,&mdash;when his hordes
on the Potomac and the Ohio had scarcely begun to
recoil from their attempted invasion of our homes and
firesides. That, at a time when the public danger
increased, a portion of the people should have increased
their factious opposition to the Government, was to the
brave soldiers struggling against an all but successful
enemy, really disheartening. In such times as these,
it should be the chief lesson of the citizen to learn, that,
however weak or lacking in wisdom the Chief of the
State may be, the only resource of the nation's safety
is for the people to rally around him as one man, and
to accomplish by spontaneous action what he fails to do.
Honor and gratitude to those who stand by their
country's Chief when danger thickens; but to those
who desert him and turn against him, let due infamy
be accorded.</p>

<p>We still had wild and ridiculous reports of the enemy
advancing upon us in great force. The Memphis <cite>Bulletin</cite>
promulgated them, and many of the soldiers
believed them with a credulity that was disgraceful.
They did not stop to think that the enemy's army was
numerically less than ours; and that his force being
manifestly equal to ours at all other points, could not
be superior to it here. Whether the generals believed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
these reports or not, it is difficult to say. At least they
began to construct fortifications at Bolivar, and for this
purpose heavy details were made each day, and the
work was pressed vigorously until, under the personal
supervision of Major General McPherson, himself an
engineer of the first order, a line of works were constructed
by no means inferior in character, and capable
of protecting the front of a large army.</p>

<p>But in the midst of these defensive operations, preparations
for a general advance began. A six months
supply of clothing, camp and garrison equipage, was
issued to the troops; draught animals were shod, and
wagons put in a state of repair; and an immense quantity
of ordnance stores was brought forward. On the
28th of October the guns of Fort Sanderson announced
the arrival of Major General Grant. In making preparations
for a campaign, the first thing a general wants
to know is the number and condition of his effective
troops, and in order to make this investigation in a
satisfactory manner, it is very desirable that he should
<em>see</em> them. Accordingly the following morning was
memorable for a grand review. The two divisions were
drawn up in hollow square near Fort Sanderson. The
lines thus formed were nearly three miles in length,
exclusive of cavalry and artillery. The appearance
of General Grant was the signal for a salvo of thirteen
guns. He rode at a slow walk along the lines, eyeing
the troops with great scrutiny. Exclusive of numbers,
there was not in this review much of the "pomp and
circumstance of war." At those points of the line where
the General was at a distance and not approaching, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
men, excessively fatigued with standing still, sat down,
and in some places the ranks became quite broken.
We then passed in review before the General, and returned
to our camp through suffocating clouds of dust.</p>

<p>Meanwhile new regiments, organized in the summer,
began to arrive, and were distributed among the old
brigades. The 4th Division was re-organized so as to
be composed of three brigades, the 1st under command
of Colonel Pugh, the 2d, of Colonel Hall, 14th Illinois,
the 3d under command of the gallant E. K. Johnson,
of the 28th Illinois. The 1st Brigade was composed
of the 3d Iowa, 53d and 103d Illinois; the 2d Brigade
of the 14th, 15th, 46th and 76th Illinois; the 3d Brigade
of the 28th and 32d Illinois, and the 53d Indiana and
12th Wisconsin. The latter was a splendid regiment
numbering nearly a thousand men. It had seen much
service, but had never been in action. The 25th Indiana
was detached from the division some time after this
at LaGrange. Until then it continued with the
2d Brigade.</p>

<p>On the 1st of November we received marching orders.
The recent order of General Halleck, reducing the transportation
of the army, was now in our cases put into
effect. We were to take but six teams to the regiment.
Officers were required to confine their baggage to
valises instead of trunks, and to turn over their surplus
baggage, at their option, to the Depot Quartermaster
for storage, who would receipt for the same. Three
days rations were taken in haversacks, and two in the
wagons. Our surplus wagons were detailed to haul
the baggage of the 103d.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<p>At daylight the camps had disappeared from the
fields, the batteries were limbered up, long lines of
baggage wagons stood where the camps had been, and
dark columns of infantry completed the scene. Before
eight o'clock the column stretched out on the Grand
Junction road. The men were in excellent spirits;
for it was generally believed that we were going this
time to stay. The road was somewhat dusty, but the
day was cool and the march easy. We made ten miles
and camped south of Spring Creek, near where General
Lauman had halted and shelled the enemy in his
memorable retreat. General McPherson believed in
military discipline; and notwithstanding the men were
tired with carrying their heavy knapsacks, he caused a
strong camp guard to be posted around each regiment,
and ordered that the men be confined strictly to its
limits. The arrangement created great displeasure
towards him. It was repeated, though in a milder
degree, in all our subsequent marches under him.
Before night, Logan's division came up and camped
near us.</p>

<p>The following day's march was characterized by a
degree of vandalism which was disgraceful to all concerned
in it, and even to the army at large. Fences
and buildings were set on fire all along the line of
march, and in some instances almost under the eye
of General Grant. Decent respect to our General
should have spared him the sight of such humiliating
occurrences. Most of it was laid to the cavalry in
advance.</p>

<p>Near Grand Junction where the State line road<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
crosses the one on which we were marching, we found
the head of General Hamilton's column, coming from
Corinth, but now at a halt and waiting for our column
to defile past and take the LaGrange road to the
right.</p>

<p>The right wing, General McPherson, went into
camp around LaGrange, and the left wing along Wolf
River, south of Grand Junction, and near Davis' Bridge.
The 3d Iowa went into camp that night on the precise
ground it had occupied in the summer. General
McPherson established his headquarters in an elegant
building near us. The railroad was repaired from
Bolivar, and preparations for a continued advance
immediately began.</p>

<p>The vandalism of both wings of the army in burning
fences and buildings on the march hither, called forth a
severe order from General Grant. This failing to accomplish
its purpose, another one was issued assessing
the amount of property destroyed to the smallest corps
to which the act could be traced, whether division,
brigade, regiment, company, detachment, or single man;
the amount to be assessed against them, or him, on their
pay rolls, and deducted from their pay. This had the
desired effect for a while, but it was soon forgotten.</p>

<p>The enemy under Van Dorn and Price were camped
south of us, at, or this side of Holly Springs. The time
we lay at this point was consumed in preparatory
reconnoissances, rebuilding the railroad bridge over
Wolf River south of Grand Junction, and otherwise
preparing for a general invasion of Mississippi.</p>

<p>About noon, November 5th, an order came to our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
regiment to march immediately in light order, taking
one day's rations in haversacks. It was a reconnoissance
of the 1st Brigade with a section of Mann's
Battery, Col. Pugh in command. Captain McCall was
in command of the 3d Iowa. We moved south, taking
the Holly Springs road, and, when about eight miles
beyond our outposts, those of the enemy came in sight.
Our infantry deployed on either side of the road, and
our artillery commenced throwing shells. The country
was open and level, and afforded a fine view. We could
see our shells strike the ground and burst about three-quarters
of a mile from us.</p>

<p>The enemy fled, and we again advanced. About sundown
our cavalry came up with the retreating cavalry
of the enemy and repulsed them after a brief skirmish,
in which the rebels lost one killed and two wounded.
Darkness coming on, we retraced our steps and arrived
in LaGrange about 9 o'clock, having made in one
afternoon a march of eighteen miles, besides some
skirmishing.</p>

<p>The following evening an order was read to our regiment
on parade that the troops of the division would
hold themselves in readiness to march in the morning
on a reconnoissance, in force, with the exception of two
regiments of Gen. Veatch's Brigade, one of which was
to be left to guard Ball's Bridge, and the other as a
reserve and for picket duty, and one regiment of Col.
Johnson's Brigade left to guard the bridge over Wolf
River on the Holly Springs road, and one battery also
to be left behind. We were to be provided with two
day's rations in haversacks, and one hundred rounds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
ammunition to the man. The imprudence of reading
such an order, on a public parade, is at once apparent.
A single citizen might have conveyed its contents to
the enemy, and he, taking advantage of our folly in
thus informing him of our force and designs, might
have punished it severely.</p>

<p>We moved at 9 o'clock, taking the Holly Springs
road. Major General McPherson was in command,
and General Lauman was also along. Captain McCall
commanded the 3d Iowa. A steady march without any
exciting incident brought us late in the afternoon to the
brick church near Lamar, where the division had camped
previously in the summer, when under Sherman. We
had scarcely stacked arms when a distant noise of skirmishing
began in front. At first we paid little attention
to it; but soon it increased into indistinct vollies.
We were ordered to keep on our accoutrements and to
be ready to fall in line at any moment. Two companies,
one of them Company K, of our regiment, under Lieut.
Lakin of Company F, were sent out as skirmishers in
a thick wood on the right. Just as we had got enough
grass pulled to sleep on, we were ordered to take a new
position, half a mile in advance.</p>

<p>We had not gone to sleep when various accounts of
the skirmishing we had heard in advance began to come
in. It proved to have been an affair of the cavalry.
Ours, three battalions, respectively, of the 1st West
Tennessee (mounted infantry), the 7th Kansas Jayhawkers
(mounted infantry), and the 2d Illinois
(cavalry), came up with the enemy's, consisting of two
battalions of Jackson's celebrated cavalry under Col.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
Montgomery. A ruse was adopted to draw the rebels
into a trap. Our mounted infantry dismounted and
concealing themselves on either side of the road, which
ran through a narrow lane, the 2d Illinois Battalion
then advanced, and coming upon the enemy, appeared
to be confounded at his numbers, and began a precipitate
retreat. The enemy pursued with great haste,
and when he came between the two lines of dismounted
infantry, they opened a sudden fire upon him. "Amazement
seized the rebel thrones." They whirled about in
great panic and began to retreat. But before they
turned, the boys had shot down several horses in the
rear of their column. Upon these poor animals, plunging
and floundering, now rushed the whole mass, pent up in
the narrow lane. The boys closed in on them, and succeeded
in securing one captain and sixty-four men,
many of whom were horribly bruised and mutilated.
Besides these, two or three had been killed.</p>

<p>But this impudent trick was soon after surpassed by
the ambitious Jayhawkers. Lying in wait, they saw a
large party of the enemy move up and post themselves
as a grand guard. The Jayhawkers waited till they got
well asleep, and then crept up behind them, and woke
them up to tell them they were prisoners. The whole
thing was accomplished without any noise or disturbance.
A few minutes after, a sergeant came up. He, too, was
taken. Then came a lieutenant and a private. They
shared the same fate.</p>

<p>I give the accounts of these exploits furnished by
men who participated in them. The prisoners we saw,
talked with, and counted. They numbered a hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
and twelve. They were without uniform, though not
ragged&mdash;but a dirty, wo-begone looking set. Many
were horribly bruised and clotted with blood. They
said that if Jackson had been in command their disaster
in the lane would never have happened. But he had
been promoted to be a brigadier general, and Montgomery,
his successor, had proven himself incompetent
to fill the place.</p>

<p>Most of the next day, the infantry and artillery
remained where they had spent the night; but the
cavalry pushed on as far as Cold Water River, where
it met the enemy in force of infantry and artillery, and
was forced back. We heard the dull booming of his
cannon when they opened upon our cavalry, and guessed
correctly what the sounds meant. Soon after, the 3d
Iowa was sent forward to support the cavalry, but after
advancing about two miles was recalled. The cavalry
retired deliberately and the enemy did not pursue.</p>

<p>About four in the afternoon, we took up the return
march for LaGrange. The air was cool, and when once
in motion we led out at a brisk pace. The dust was
somewhat annoying, but what was more so, the troops
had set fire to the fields and fences, and we were compelled
to march along burning lanes through intense
smoke and heat, between two lines of fire. We reached
our camps about eight o'clock in the evening.</p>

<p>After this reconnoissance, by order of General McPherson,
the ammunition in the cartridge boxes of the
men was inspected each day on dress parade by a staff
officer sent for the purpose. Forty rounds of cartridge
were furnished each man, and whenever a deficiency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
was found that the soldier could not account for, he was
charged at the rate of fifty cents for each cartridge.
The boys were very careful never to get caught without
their full number. Should they find their number short,
it was easy to borrow for the time of some comrade who
did not go on parade. When the marches again commenced
the arrangement was dispensed with.</p>

<p>About this time General Lauman was succeeded in
the command of the 4th Division by Brig. Gen. McKean.
Our regiment listened to his parting orders with extreme
regret. I do not know whether this feeling
was common to the whole division; but the soldiers
of the 1st Brigade felt that he was their general,
and feared our division would not get another commander
who would be so proud of his trust and fulfil it
so well.</p>

<p>At LaGrange, Col. Williams again joined us. His
appearance was greeted with many demonstrations of
disrespect on the part of the rank and file. Captain
Smith, who had been home on recruiting service, came
with him. The Captain was well and warmly received.
Lieutenant Crosley also joined us about that time; but
was soon after detailed as aid on the staff of the
brigade. Lieut. Col. Trumbull, who had been compelled
to remain behind on account of sickness, joined us from
Bolivar. He soon after tendered his resignation for
reasons which were well understood and appreciated by
his friends. It was not without much difficulty that he
procured its acceptance, General McPherson at first
refusing his concurrence. With scarcely an exception,
he parted from us with the sincere regrets and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
good wishes of the whole regiment, both officers and
men.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The morning of the 23d of November is memorable
for the most remarkable march ever performed by our
regiment. The enemy's cavalry appeared in our rear
in the direction of Somerville, about sixteen miles northeast
of LaGrange. Our cavalry was at the time busy
with the enemy in front. Accordingly, the 3d Iowa,
the 41st Illinois and a section of artillery were sent to
look after them. We marched at six o'clock. Colonel
Trumbull stood before his tent as we started. The
tears came into the gallant Colonel's eyes as he looked
at the boys for the last time. We were delayed for
some reason near General McKean's head quarters, and
did not leave the town till eight o'clock. Marching
leisurely, and halting for a short rest, at a small stream
seven miles out, we reached Somerville at one o'clock.
The guerrillas were of course gone. After resting till
half past two, we began the return march. Our regiment,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>which had hitherto been in the rear, was now in
advance. The column at once assumed a brisk gait.
Soon after, a courier arrived with a dispatch from Gen.
McKean to hasten back, as a general movement was on
foot. The speed of the march was now accelerated, so
as to keep the artillery horses much of the time at a
trot. The officers must have known that it was impossible
for the men to march at so unreasonable a gait;
to keep in the ranks was out of the question. Many
fell behind and some sank exhausted by the way. It
was after dark when we reached the creek where we
had rested in the forenoon. Here about two hundred,
including the stragglers that came up, remained and
passed the night without an officer or a picket posted.
It was perhaps well that the enemy did not know their
situation. When we reached the pickets, many more
fell out of the ranks and remained around their fires.
Only about twenty men and two officers reached camp
with their colors&mdash;a fitting eulogium on fast marching.
Nearly all, however, were present at morning roll-call,
thus showing that they did not leave the ranks from a
disposition not to acquit themselves in the most creditable
manner. This extraordinary march of thirty-two
miles in twelve hours called forth a complimentary order
from General McKean.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Capt. Brown, whose resignation had been
accepted at Bolivar, returned as major, and assumed
command of the regiment, Col. Williams still being sick.
The captain had been promoted while home, at the request
of a majority of the officers of the regiment. His appointment
gave very general satisfaction among the men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p>General Grant returned from Columbus, whither he
had been to consult with Gen. Sherman. He reviewed
the troops by brigades, and caused orders to be issued
for the animals to be shod and subsistence drawn for
an immediate march. The enemy was in force and
fortified at Abbeville, south of Holly Springs, on the
Tallahatchie. General Sherman marched from Memphis
on the 26th of November, taking direction to the
right of his position. Orders came on the 27th for us
to march in the morning at 6 o'clock, taking all our
baggage, three days rations in haversacks, and two in
wagons. On account of the limited transportation, we
would have to carry our knapsacks, now containing our
winter's supply of clothing, and very heavy. On this
account we promised ourselves anything but an easy
march.</p>

<p>Reveille sounded at 4 o'clock. We cooked breakfast,
packed knapsacks and haversacks, filled canteens,
loaded wagons and fell into line. Major Brown was in
the saddle. It was cheering to the members of Company
F, to see their former esteemed Captain at the
head of the regiment. The field music struck up the
old familiar marching tune, "The Girl I left behind
me," and the regiment marched out and took its position
in the column on the bluffs of the river. Here we
waited for the 2d and 3d Brigades to pass, watching in
the meantime their column of dark infantry mixed with
white covered wagons, as it extended to the south. It
was a grand spectacle to see the right wing of the
army stretching over those broad and open fields further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
into the land of the enemy. And when each soldier
thought, "I am a part of this grand movement; little
as I am, I am helping to make history," he felt an
exultation known only to men in the hour of great
enterprises or of great success.</p>

<p>The left wing was also in motion on the road south
from Grand Junction. Where that road unites with the
one on which we were marching, six miles south of Wolf
River, the right wing halted, and the left wing assumed
the advance.</p>

<p>The roads were most favorable for marching, but the
sky was overcast with leaden clouds, and the wind blew
cold and raw from the northwest. During the frequent
halts occasioned by the great length of the trains, the
men would tear down the fences and build fires, around
which to warm themselves. So frequent were the halts,
and so great the length of the column, that before night
the way was almost a continuous line of fire. These
fires extended through the dry leaves and stubble, and
communicated themselves to the fences, till at length
we seemed to be marching through a perpetual bonfire.
The sun went down, and darkness began to gather
around, when, all at once through a sudden rift in the
gloomy clouds, the red twilight broke gloriously, while
to the east whither the wind was blowing, the flames
of burning fences, fields and buildings, lit up the sky,
which glared vengefully upon us as we marched along.
It was a scene worthy a poet or painter. It was the
splendor of desolation. A vast invading army marching
through a blaze of the ruin it had made! Whether
it were intentional or accidental, we could not but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
deplore such a destruction of property. We knew that
the world would consider such doings intentional, and
that they would be a lasting stigma upon our name.
There were some among us that rejoiced at it; but
many shuddered instinctively at seeing ourselves re-enacting
the deeds which have made the name of <i>vandal</i>
the execration of all ages.</p>

<p>The advance infantry camped for the night at Cold
Water. But our division, though it marched two hours
after night, camped near the familiar brick church
south of Lamar. Here there was no water for the
animals, and scarcely enough for the men. The wagons
parked as they traveled, by brigades. On account of
the weight of our knapsacks, the slowness of the march,
and the frequent halts, we were excessively fatigued,
and when the order was given to file to the right, we had
scarcely patience enough left to go through the remaining
movement of halt!&mdash;close up&mdash;front! center dress!
front! fix-bayonets! shoulder-arms! stack-arms!
break ranks&mdash;march!</p>

<p>And here a stranger could have observed in all its
reality the habits of the old soldier on the march. His
knapsack is packed, not according to regulations, but
to suit his own convenience. His haversack contains
three days rations of bread, sugar and coffee, and a sure
supply of salt. For his meat he trusts chiefly to fortune
and to the enemy's pig-pens and henroosts. Outside
his haversack hangs all that is left of some merry oyster
supper,&mdash;a small tin can with a wire bail&mdash;his coffee
pot. His canteen is never empty when water can be
procured, unless it contains something sweeter or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
stronger than water. When the regiment halts for the
night and breaks ranks, his first purpose is to explore
the near neighborhood, and espy and seize whatever he
can of fresh meat, which having brought in, he divides
liberally among his comrades, after reserving the best
piece to himself. He then proceeds to improvise a fire,
if his comrades have not a place for him by the side
of theirs. And here let me say to all uninitiated soldiers,
that whatever may be said in favor of green
hickory, or dry oak tops, experience has taught me that
well-seasoned rails make decidedly the best camp-fire in
Secession Land. When he has built his fire, by chance
he draws his gun from the stack, and brings his knapsack
close to the welcome blaze, and sits down upon it,
with his canteen, haversack and cartridge-box at hand.
He fills his "coffee kettle" and puts it on the coals.
He cuts a piece of meat, salts it, sticks his ramrod into
it, and commences broiling it in the blaze. And then,
should the Orderly Sergeant be heard calling him to go
on guard or fatigue,&mdash;well, no one will blame me for
not rehearsing word for word the strict manner in which
he complains of the Fates. If he is so fortunate as
to escape this, when his supper is over (relished no
where so well), he gathers a heap of dry leaves, or it
may be, breaks a bundle of broom sedge, upon which he
spreads his blankets, and soon, his feet to the fire and
his head in the land of cool air and pleasant dreams,
till the morning drum or the night alarm, he is oblivious
to the weary world.</p>

<p>Ranging among the fires, the stranger will perceive
that the manner of this soldier varies greatly among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
the others. Some, like him, find it good to be alone.
Others, like geese, choose their mates and go in pairs.
Others, gregarious, go in herds of six or eight. These
variations in the size of families, cause as many modifications
in the mode of life, which in all cases has
reference to the general principle of acquiring the most
comfort with the least possible labor.</p>

<p>November 29. We were aroused early, and were
ready to move at daylight. But we were to be rear
guard to-day, and had to wait for other troops to move
out. The sun rose. Weary and stiff, we slung knapsacks
and moved into the road. Slowly and with much
halting the trains took the road, and by eight o'clock
the column was again in motion. The roads were
dusty, and the halts were more frequent and annoying
than yesterday.</p>

<p>At 2 P.&nbsp;M., we reached Cold Water, where the left
wing camped last night. Here we halted to rest and
water our animals, and it was after dark when the
march was resumed, and we did not reach Holly
Springs till 11 P.&nbsp;M. Here we halted for the night.
We built fires of the garden fences, and made our beds
of forage taken from the barns of the citizens. Who
could blame us? When the alternative was a cheerless
night with no supper but that in our haversacks, and a
bed upon the damp ground, what soldier would have
done less?</p>

<p>And now, once more, those of the dwellers of this beautiful
city who had not fled with their retiring army, saw
on all sides the camp fires of "the Invader," and heard
upon their sidewalks the tread of "Vandal" sentinels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>

<p>November 30&mdash;Sunday. The drums woke us at four
o'clock, and though our short sleep had illy sufficed to
refresh us, the admonitions of our officers, that we were
soon to march, forbade any further attempt at repose.
At daylight, the 3d Iowa leading the Division, we
marched through the principal street of the city, with
our files neatly dressed, to the sound of martial music.
Vain parade! There were no citizens to witness it&mdash;none
to admire it. If we had a terror for our enemy,
we had inspired it in the confusion of battle, not by
keeping step on review to sounds of fife and drum.</p>

<p>The day was cloudy, and the wind blew soft and damp
from the south. For a while we moved rapidly; but
soon subsided into a more reasonable gait. In the forenoon,
while taking a short rest, we experienced a perceptible
shock of an earthquake, which was also felt at
Cairo and St. Louis. Reports frequently came that the
cavalry division under Colonel Dickey, were skirmishing
with the enemy's rear guard, and that he had captured
two cannon.</p>

<p>As we approached Lumkin's Mills, a sudden burst
of artillery saluted our ears. The sound put Colonel
Pugh in ecstacies; and looking around, he called out in
his peculiar tone of voice, "Boys, d' ye hear that?"
The discharges were frequent and the deep valleys
prolonged the sounds into deep echoes such as we had
never heard before. It was the cavalry division engaging
the enemy's nearest troops north of the Tallahatchie.
This firing lasted nearly two hours, and not
knowing the cause of it, we took it to be the beginning
of a general engagement. We had been the rearmost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
division in the march; and coming up with the troops
of the other divisions, we found them camped on a high,
commanding ridge which rises along the north bank
of the stream which turns Lumkin's Mills, and overlooks
a more level tract southward toward the Tallahatchie.
We camped in advance of them, the 1st Brigade on the
plain in the extreme advance.</p>

<p>The cannonade died away with the daylight; and
soon after the artillery of Heaven in louder and longer
echoes began to shake the hills. We hastily put up
tents in expectation of a storm. It came sweeping
from the west with loud crashings of thunder&mdash;a perfect
tornado. Our tents fell before it, and the water ran in
streams under our blankets. Many of us were compelled
to seek warmth around our re-enkindled fires.
And here, though the body suffered, the mind could not
but feel exalted in the presence of such a grand commotion
of the elements. The crashing thunder, the
intense darkness, relieved only by the frequent lightnings
and the camp fires of the army extending far and
wide to the north, and the rushing wind, were in the
highest degree sublime. In the morning God had
shaken the earth; in the evening man had shaken the
heavens, and now God was shaking both the heavens
and the earth.</p>

<p>December 1st. The day was without rain, but the
wind cold and raw, blew broken masses of clouds from
the north. It was reported that Sherman with a strong
column had crossed the Tallahatchie, nine miles below
the enemy's works, flanked him and compelled him to
retreat. That evening McArthur's division hastily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
advanced, and during the entire following forenoon, the
troops filed through our camps, advancing to the south.
Our division and that now under command of Gen. Ross
were left at this point; for what purpose, officers and
men were alike unable to conjecture.</p>

<p>Trains were sent back to Lamar for rations, and the
engineer troops were busy repairing the railroad southward
from that point. General Sherman returned to
Memphis to begin his expedition against Vicksburg,
and General Grant, his column augmented by Denver's
division of Sherman's troops, was pushing forward after
the enemy. The details of his marches we knew only
by report. The cavalry division pushed the enemy's
rear guard with splendid results. Many prisoners
passed to the rear, and we listened with thrilling interest
to rehearsals of the gallant conduct of this portion of
the army. The character of the cavalry, so much
depreciated since the battle of Shiloh, now took a
sudden rise in our estimation. In the romantic ideas
of some of the young soldiers, "the man on the horse"
came to be all in all. And many were frequently
heard, regretting their misfortune in having enlisted in
the infantry.</p>

<p>Meantime General McKean was relieved from active
duty at his own request, and early on the morning of
the 11th, started north with his staff. The division
had received marching orders the night before, and the
same morning at six o'clock we took up the march
toward the south.</p>

<p>The weather was soft and delightful, and the roads
all that could be desired. At ten o'clock we reached the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
enemy's late advance works in front of the Tallahatchie.
They consisted of a single line of rifle pits with embrasures
at three points, sufficient each for a battery of
light guns. They were by no means formidable, and
the ground north of them was higher than that on which
they were erected; but their field of fire was open and
level, and they could not have been carried by direct
assault without some loss. They were constructed to
defend the bridge across the Tallahatchie. Beyond the
river we came upon his main fort, its front and lateral
faces angling with the river, and very nearly closing
behind. It was a formidable work, its parapet thick
and high, and its ditch wide and deep, with some interior
arrangements which I did not comprehend, and rifle
pits extending from its flanks, the whole buried in an
impenetrable forest of bottom timber. So dense was
this timber, that artillery could not have been brought
to bear on them with success, and direct assault in the
presence of the intervening river would have been out
of the question.</p>

<p>As we marched through these works, we said among
ourselves, "If the enemy could not hold such a place
as this, where this side of Vicksburg will he make a
stand? Our advance then will be a continued march of
victory." Thus in exultation we pressed on.</p>

<p>Three miles south of the Tallahatchie we passed
Abbeville, a small railroad station garrisoned by a few
troops. We camped for the night on Hurricane Creek,
a small stream six miles north of Oxford.</p>

<p>The country through which we passed south of the
Tallahatchie was mountainous and picturesque. Sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
we would ascend high ranges of hills which would
give us a wide view of the country; whence we could
see other ranges lying blue and dim in the distance, and
far to the right the deep and sleepy looking valley
of the Tallahatchie. It afforded a delightful contrast to
the monotonous woods, interrupted only by sparse plantations,
which, on our previous marches in the South,
had bounded to narrow distances the inquiring vision,
and rose round us like a prison wall.</p>

<p>December 12th. We resumed the march early, and
at nine o'clock passed through Oxford, a very pleasant
looking little city, but bounded on all sides by the
inevitable oak forest of these regions. It was chiefly
noted as being the site of the University of Mississippi.
This building, built of brick, in the western environs
of the city, rose in stately relief against the dark woods
and above the meaner edifices surrounding it, and was
one of the few objects that commanded our united respect,
even in a land of traitors.</p>

<p>A march of twelve miles further, accomplished with
much fatigue and straggling, brought us in sight of the
main army camped along Yockona Creek. Here General
Lauman was waiting to assume command of the division.
His return was greeted throughout our regiment with
great joy. That night we enjoyed the luxury of a
drizzling Southern rain, and the next morning we put
up tents and laid out our camp in regular order. The
103d Illinois had been left behind at Waterford, and
now the 33d Wisconsin was attached to the 1st Brigade
to supply its place. This regiment had advanced with
Sherman's column from Memphis, and then countermarched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
to Waterford, and then again advanced to join
the main army: in consequence of which, their supply
of rations was either so much exhausted or wasted, that
they were reduced to three-fourths of the regular allowance.
In addition to this, the vigilance and energy
of the provost marshal had rendered it impossible for
inexperienced soldiers to draw many supplies from the
country. In this situation their complaints, as might
have been expected from young soldiers, were boisterous
and perhaps unreasonable. Indeed, they seemed to us
to act very foolishly. They abused without restraint
their quartermaster and other officers, and accused them
of stealing their rations. They would besiege their
colonel's tent in great crowds, clamoring for rations.
All day, with scarcely an interruption, the cry of
"<i>crackers!</i>" rang from their camp; and long before
reveille, of mornings, the woods would echo to the cry
of "<i>crackers! crackers!</i>" And in the middle of the
night, if they said aught, talking in their sleep, it would
be to repeat that inevitable and all-meaning word,
crackers. Now we pitied them; and as far as we were
able, shared our rations with them. But we could not
but be amused at the vehement manner in which they
expressed their impatience; for it called to mind ludicrous
recollections of the days when we were young
soldiers ourselves.</p>

<p>The army rested in this position, and waited the opening
of railroad communications from Holly Springs.
In a week the cars were running from Yockona Station.
The cavalry division had sustained its first defeat near
Coffeeville&mdash;a severe repulse at the hands of the enemy's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
infantry and artillery. This seemed to indicate his
intention to dispute the occupation of Grenada, where
he was said to be strongly fortified. But this result
might have been anticipated by the cavalry, when,
already beyond the reach of support from the infantry,
they had pushed on against a vigilant and skillful
enemy. He had taken advantage of their temerity and
punished it severely; but, to the army in general, the
affair was not of a serious character.</p>

<p>But the enemy's cavalry under Van Dorn, late their
commanding general in Mississippi, was preparing a blow
for our campaign, and it fell suddenly where it was least
expected. Most of the cavalry division was recalled
from the front, and part of it under Colonel Dickey was
sent east, to make a raid on the Mobile and Ohio Railroad,
while the other part under Colonel Lee proceeded
north to protect the communications from the designs
of Forrest, who was moving on our railroad lines in
Tennessee. About noon of the 19th, the Ohio Brigade
of Ross' division, camped two miles south of Oxford,
moved on the cars toward the north, passed through
Holly Springs that evening, and arrived at Bolivar some
time in the night. The same day Colonel Dickey, on
his return, crossed the trail of Van Dorn, who was then
moving to the north on his raid, and apprised General
Grant of his movements, but too late to enable him to
take measures to check them.</p>

<p>On the 20th, intimations that Van Dorn had captured
Holly Springs came to the troops, first in the shape
of vague rumors, and then of more definite reports. Immediate
dispositions were made to meet the new danger.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
McArthur's division was sent to the north to open up
the communications. The same night, orders came to
the 4th Division to be ready to march at an early hour.
The noise of preparation was kept up far into the night.
In the midst of this, across the valley to the north of
our regiment, we heard a tumult which sounded like a
thousand watch-dogs, joining all hideously in their midnight
orgies. It was a row between the 14th and 15th
Illinois regiments on one side, and the 16th Illinois on
the other. I believe it was confined entirely to words.</p>

<p>At six o'clock in the morning the division moved, and,
passing to the east, crossed the railroad at Yockona Station,
and, after proceeding about four miles, camped on
the ground just abandoned by McArthur's division. We
laid out camps in the regular manner, got up tents, and
in the evening our regiment had dress parade, at which
was read an order from General McPherson that the
troops of the right wing would be put on three-quarter
rations. Towards night marching orders came to the
artillery, and late in the night orders came to the infantry
to be ready to march early in the morning.</p>

<p>Reveille beat at 3&frac12; o'clock, and at sunrise we turned
our faces to the north and our backs upon all our
dreams of conquest and glory. We began to retreat.
The rubbish of our camps was on fire, and the mill
which had been impressed to grind corn for us, wrapt in
flames, sent a column of dense smoke into the air. The
41st Illinois was detailed to tear up the railroad. We
looked upon all this with blank astonishment. But it
was no fiction; the campaign was abandoned; the whole
army was in retreat! We were bewildered. But out
of this disappointment we endeavored to kindle a glow
of hope; and out of this failure, we endeavored to persuade
ourselves that victory would yet come. All felt
the event keenly, and it could not be expected that there
would be no murmurings. But the army of the Tennessee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
was too patriotic in spirit and too brave in heart
to be demoralized at this. Each soldier endeavored to
put on a cheerful air, and each sought for hope in the
countenances and conversation of his comrades. I will
not endeavor to recount the reasonings and conjectures
with which we endeavored to justify and excuse the
retreat; nor the manner in which others more despondent
complained of it. Many, however, seemed to think
that we could have taken Grenada and maintained ourselves
there, subsisting on the country, until communication
by railroad could have been opened with Memphis.</p>

<p>Passing through Oxford, we camped on Hurricane
Creek where we had camped on the night of the 11th.
The 41st came up before dark and reported that they
had performed their job quite to their own satisfaction.
We believed them. All night the cars plied rapidly
between Oxford and Abbeville removing cotton and
Government stores. A bright light shone over the city
during the entire night, and we judged that the troops
remaining there were setting fire to portions of it, but
never received any direct confirmation of our conjectures.</p>

<p>In the morning, our trains were sent forward under
a strong guard, and during the forenoon, Quimby's
Division filed past us. Thus the 4th Division was left
to cover and protect the retreat. Orders were had for
the men to remain by their colors in readiness for anything
that might occur. To prevent straggling Major
Brown ordered roll-call in our regiment every two
hours, the results to be reported in writing to him. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
remained here another night, and heard the frequent
noise and whistle of the cars&mdash;sounds which seemed
more in keeping with a time of peace than of war.</p>

<p>Next morning, the drums beat early, and we received
orders to prepare for action or a march at a moment's
notice. We had been exposed all night to the luxury
of a drizzling rain, which still continued, and made the
prospect of the day anything but agreeable. At eight
o'clock we slung knapsacks and fell in, but were kept
standing in ranks till afternoon before commencing the
march.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon we passed Abbeville, and there
saw a small garrison protecting the depot inside of a
redoubt of cotton bales. It looked decidedly aristocratic.
Dirt breastworks would not do. It was too cheap.
They must have it made out of something worth fifty
cents a pound. Well, luxuries among soldiers are so
rare, who could envy them that? We camped a short
distance from the enemy's rifle pits north of the Tallahatchie.</p>

<p>Here coming up with our comrades of the train, we
found they had balm for our wounded spirits in the
shape of prodigious camp reports of victories at all
points. Burnside had not only defeated the enemy on
the Rappahannock and taken Richmond&mdash;Sherman had
not only taken Vicksburg and Banks Port Hudson, but
peace was actually declared! There were men in the
27th Iowa and 33d Wisconsin that would bet their bounties
on it. Of course we did not believe these reports
to their full extent, but, we thought there might be something
in them, and the thought encouraged us greatly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p>

<p>The following day was Christmas. We ate our &frac34;
rations and celebrated it soberly and seriously. Our
example would have been an excellent one to those
Christians, who, under more favorable circumstances,
celebrate the birth of Christ by stimulating their animal
propensities with rich meat and strong wine. We fasted
somewhat; and if yearning is prayer, we prayed&mdash;prayed
for deliverance from our gloomy situation, and
to be put on a new road of victory.</p>

<p>We changed camp two miles to the northeast, and
camped in line on the extreme left of the army, looking
to the south. We sent out a forage train which came
in abundantly loaded.</p>

<p>The cavalry brigade which had been sent to make a
raid on the Mobile and Ohio Railroad, returned, successful,
having torn up several miles of track, burned a
warehouse of rebel stores, and made large captures of
horses. Indeed every soldier of the 4th Illinois Cavalry
seemed to have brought with him at least two horses
and one contraband. The news of this little success,
however unimportant, did something toward mitigating
our gloom.</p>

<p>Meanwhile our provisions, "like the lingering sands
of an hour glass," were fast running out. To prolong,
if possible, the expected period of final starvation, Gen.
McPherson issued another order reducing us to half
rations. Lumkin's mills, six miles to the north, were
put to grinding corn for our division; but the supply
of meal thus obtained fell far short of furnishing us
with bread-stuff, but we found an excellent substitute
in hulled corn and in black peas which abounded in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
corn-fields adjacent to our camp. We had also a corral
which was supplied with beef (?) cattle, picked up in the
surrounding country. And <i>such cattle</i>! Some were so
poor as to be almost transparent. The boys actually
averred that the butchers had to prop up one or two old
oxen to shoot them! Our forage trains penetrated the
country in all directions to find subsistence for the animals;
in one instance going twenty-two miles from
camp, and being gone two days. Thus the sweets of
the enemy's success at Holly Springs was embittered
to the whole country for many miles around, our army
being put under tribute to supply its wants. And it
must be confessed that notwithstanding the vigilance of
the provost marshal who was now getting to be a most
unpopular individual, the people suffered more from
unauthorized seizures by soldiers who accompanied
forage trains, or who, impelled by hunger, scouted the
vicinity of the camps in bands, than in any legitimate
way.</p>

<p>In the midst of this, we had our full rations of parades,
inspections and reviews, and we more than once wondered
if the generals were on half rations like the men.
I do not believe they were.</p>

<p>The new year came; but it brought no rejoicings, no
feastings, no comforts, no news from home. There was
nothing to alleviate the general despondency, if we
except an order from General McPherson announcing
General Sullivan's victory at Parker's Cross Roads
over Forest who had been destroying our railroad communications
north of Jackson; also, that he had received
a telegram from General Grant at Holly Springs, announcing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
a sharp fight near Nashville, with Johnson
badly cut up and falling back. The order closed with
the words, "Bully for New Years, with the compliments
of General McPherson."</p>

<p>So far the winter had been mild. We had had but
little snow. We had had none of those cold winds
which, at this season of the year, sweep over our northern
prairies. The ground had not been frozen so deep but
that a half day's sun sufficed to thaw it out. We had
had spells of very warm weather, warm as September
in the North, followed by the inevitable soaking rains
of the South. And yet, if we except the traveled roads
and level bottoms, the ground had not been muddy.
The clay hills seemed impervious to water, which, flowing
from them, cut immense ditches down which great
quantities of soil are yearly washed away. But it was
a question whether this waste of soil was much of a
loss to the fields; for on the surface the soil seemed to
be of the same consistence it was six feet below. They
are compelled to plow around these hills and circle
them with ditches to prevent this wasteful washing. If
the climate were not favorable to the production of
cotton, it was the universal verdict of my comrades
that they would not give a dollar an acre for the
uplands of northern Mississippi. But it is not surprising
that we should be unfavorably impressed with a
country that afforded us such meager hospitalities.</p>

<p>Our picket duty was quite heavy. The details were
made by regiments. For instance, on a given day the
3d Iowa would be required to furnish 300 men, embracing
a specified proportion of officers and non-commissioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
officers. Other regiments would furnish a
similar number, and so the detail would go round the
division.</p>

<p>On the 3d of January we received a meager mail
from home, and the following day papers arrived announcing
for the first time that General Burnside had
been defeated at Fredericksburg. We also learned to our
mortification that Vicksburg was not taken. But this
news had a transient compensation in reports, coming
from no one knows what source, that Burnside had
again crossed the Rappahannock and gained a great
victory, and that Sherman was only waiting the arrival
of Banks, when Vicksburg would certainly fall. At
any rate we were always in luck or about to be. But
what was still more agreeable was the arrival of a day's
full rations, and news that our railroad communications
were open to Memphis by way of LaGrange.</p>

<p>On the 5th of January, our division broke up camp
on the Tallahatchie, and again took up the northward
march. When the column had formed on the main road,
General Lauman rode along and the boys of our regiment
cheered him lustily. The country through which
we passed, particularly in the vicinity of Waterford
and Lumkin's Mills was putrid with the offal of slaughtered
animals and the <i>debris</i> of deserted camps. The
animals in our beef corral were driven along with us.
They were the most motley looking herd we ever beheld;
oxen that could not make a shadow; cows of the most
lilliputian dimensions; embryo calves (for indeed they
seemed intended for calves); and sheep that would not
make a meal for a rat terrier. These, we were told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
were a fair specimen of Mississippi cattle! The herd
would have made a menagerie worth a northern man's
fifty cents in the hardest times.</p>

<p>Before we reached Holly Springs, Gen. McPherson
received a dispatch from General Grant stating that
Sherman had captured Vicksburg with 20,000 prisoners.
The report was circulated along the column and caused
great rejoicing. Reaching Holly Springs we found conflicting
reports among the troops; and though the latest
dispatches did not warrant the belief that Vicksburg
was taken, we clung to the pleasant delusion, and for a
long time would not believe that Sherman had been
defeated.</p>

<p>We found Denver's Division here. The 109th Illinois
was also here, and, with the exception of Company K,
was in confinement for mutiny. The case of these
traitors has become a matter of history. As regiment
after regiment of the division passed their guard house,
the boys growled and hooted at them in the most decisive
manner.</p>

<p>We camped on the beautiful level ground north of the
city. Gen. Grant still had his head quarters at Holly
Springs, and our regiment furnished his head quarter
guard.</p>

<p>At two o'clock the following morning, reveille began
to beat in the camps of Denver's Division, and we knew
they were preparing to march. No sooner had they
evacuated their camps than our boys rushed to them,
bearing away tables, bunks, boards, everything that
could assist in furnishing our tents, or making them
more comfortable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span></p>

<p>All the troops except the 4th Division were withdrawn
to the line of the Memphis and Charleston Railroad.
Our division was left to cover the evacuation of
the country and protect the removal of property. The
1st and 2d brigades occupying Holly Springs; the 3d
yet remaining at Lumkin's Mills. On the 7th, a guard
was sent to the latter place to bring forward a wagon
train. It returned without molestation. The next day,
the 3d Brigade joined us, which was quite a relief, as
hitherto our picket duty had been very heavy. The cars
were busy night and day removing stores, cotton, and
negro women and children. The same day, January
8th, the cavalry, which had been watching the front,
moved to the rear, and all felt confident the infantry
and artillery would go the next day. And now we
were to witness a tragedy which reflects infamy upon
its perpetrators, and a dishonor upon the 4th Division.</p>

<p>Under the belief that we would move in the morning,
a number of soldiers of the different regiments met and
concerted a scheme for firing the city. Shortly after
dark, the flames broke out in its eastern limits, and did
not spread, but soon rose in another quarter. We saw
it from our camp with little amazement; for we could
not but expect that there would be found some reckless
enough to undertake to execute the threats of vengeance
made by exasperated soldiers against the citizens, on
account of their conduct towards our prisoners captured
by Van Dorn in his raid. The provost guards in some
instances did their duty, arresting the incendiaries; but
generally they connived at their operations. The flames
spread and broke out in new directions. Two additional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
regiments were ordered on duty as provost guards.
Generals McPherson and Lauman rode through the
city with their escorts and endeavored to arrest the
work of barbarism. But their efforts were unavailing.
Men, seizing their guns and accoutrements, ran into the
city from all the camps, and filled the streets with bogus
guards, whose purpose was to counteract the operations
of the real ones. By 9 o'clock the confusion was at its
hight&mdash;hideous and indescribable. The fiendish yells
of the assassins and their accomplices, the shrieks of
women and children, the shouts of the swaying crowds,
applauding or rebuking, the commands of officers, the
rushing sounds of the devouring flames, and the crash
of falling timbers, mingled all their noises together.
Citizens assisted by soldiers vainly endeavored to arrest
the flames. The rich and the poor; the friendly and
the unfriendly were served alike. The most stately
residences and the meanest hovels were alike consumed.
Not even the negro quarters were spared. To whatever
could make a blaze, the incendiaries applied the
torch. In the midst of it all, but few collisions took
place, and but one casualty was reported, the wounding
of a member of the 41st Illinois by a provost guard.</p>

<p>From our camp, the spectacle was grand in the extreme.
The flames illuminated the heavens far around,
and sent up huge columns of red smoke, which, driven
by the south wind, rolled over our heads in clouds
reflecting the yellow light and shutting out the dark
storm clouds above. We saw from our camp the splendid
sight; but we did not hear the cries of the helpless around
the flames and over the ashes of their once happy homes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span></p>

<p>The conflagration raged unabated till midnight, when
the long roll beat in all the camps. The men sprang
from their sleep, gathered their arms and accoutrements
and fell in line. Presently an orderly came along with
an order for roll-call to be had in each company, and
the absentees noted and reported to head quarters. It
is due to the good name of our regiment, to say that but
two men were found absent at this time. Indeed, it
would be an unusual thing, when camped in the vicinity
of a large city, for a sudden midnight roll-call to find all
the men in their quarters.</p>

<p>Comrades, I have pictured this scene as we saw and
heard it. If it was right for soldiers to behave thus,
let no one be ashamed that those who did so belonged
to the 4th Division. If it was wrong, as the guilty
ones are unknown, the disgrace falls upon us in common.
That many justified it who did not participate in it, can
not be denied. It is equally true, that many denounced
it.</p>

<p>Let us give both sides a fair hearing. Those who
justified it said, that when the place was captured on
the 20th by Van Dorn, the women insulted our comrades
who had surrendered, firing pistols and throwing
bricks at them. There was not a Union man in the
city. It had been in the past, and if not destroyed,
would be in the future, a rendezvous for the enemy.
Every family would give him aid; every roof would
give him comfort. We had tried the kid glove policy
and it had failed. Our enemies were traitors to a
Government, the noblest in the world, and which had
never wronged them. They were neither legitimate nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
honorable enemies. We must teach them that we looked
upon their treason as a crime. Had we left our homes
and all the comforts of life, and come here to guard
rebel property? If the contrary policy were adopted,
the rebels would soon yield. They would not endure
to see their property destroyed and their families
brought to distress. Desertion would soon disorganize
their armies, and leave us no more fighting to do.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it was said the war should be
conducted honorably and according to the rules of warfare
among civilized nations. War had its reciprocal
justice; and we should not do to our enemies what we
would not expect them to do to us, under like circumstances.
The enemy was a traitor; that was true; but
he was also a formidable power; and if we were to
carry on the war with violence and outrage, he could
and would retaliate. Until we had shown ourselves
able to destroy the rebel hosts in the field, we should
not direct our warfare against the women and children.
All the advantages we had gained over the enemy had
been gained by bravery in battle; not by cruelty elsewhere.
Violence was not vigor. Energy in prosecuting
the war, did not imply cruelty toward those whom its
fortunes had placed in our hands. Let us march against
the enemy's armies; defeat, pursue and destroy them.
Then would the world applaud our valor. And, if we
protected the unarmed, the helpless and innocent, it
would applaud our magnanimity. If the contrary policy
were adopted,&mdash;if we burned down over their heads the
homes of women and children; if we left them shelterless
in mid-winter and without food;&mdash;if we thus turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
a deaf ear to the common appeals of humanity, what
sympathy could we expect from civilized nations? How,
under such circumstances, could we expect neutrality
from them, to say nothing of friendship? It would
exasperate our enemies in arms to new vigor as well as
to new cruelty; it would cause non-combatants to take
up arms, and bring against us foreign powers. Thus
would we be overwhelmed with our own wickedness
and folly.</p>

<p>But, more than this, respect for our duties as soldiers,&mdash;respect
for the oath we had taken, should
restrain us from violating the positive and repeated
orders of our commanding generals. If the Government
chose to inaugurate the policy of burning and laying
waste, and we were commanded to execute it, we would
obey; the responsibility would not be ours. We had
enlisted, not to be the Government, but to serve it; and
until we were commanded to commit such acts, our
moral instincts should teach us to refrain from committing
them. That our generals had been compelled to
issue orders admonishing us against such conduct, was
itself a humiliation. Every soldier in our ranks should
understand the dignity of his mission, and feel that the
cause of civilization needs not the weapons of barbarism
for its defense.</p>

<p>When the morning came the conflagration had not
ceased; but, from hour, to hour the flames continued to
break out in different places in the suburbs of the city.
At 10 A.&nbsp;M., we received orders to prepare to march
immediately. Our wagons were soon loaded and sent
forward, and the troops were called into line. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
trains of cars continued to arrive and depart, loaded to
their utmost capacity with negro women and children.
Still we were kept in line, doubtless with the object
of preventing a further destruction of the city. It was
not till eight o'clock at night that we began to move.
The roads were slippery and deep with mud. There
was no moon in the early part of the night, and our only
light was the conflagration, still raging behind us, and
the blaze of burning fences and buildings on either hand.
It was nearly midnight, when we reached Cold Water,
and halted for rest and sleep.</p>

<p>Early in the morning, we took up the march on the
Moscow road. We passed a camp of cavalry north
of the stream as we crossed it,&mdash;all that now remained
of the invading army fronting the enemy in Mississippi.
And here we could not help but contrast our present
feelings with those with which we had entered upon the
campaign. Then in Virginia, in Middle Tennessee, and
with us in Mississippi,&mdash;everywhere victory seemed
preparing. Now, looking around us, we saw how our
dream of victory and peace had vanished. Defeated at
Fredericksburg; repulsed at Vicksburg; a hard earned,
fruitless victory at Murfreesborough,&mdash;checked everywhere
except in Mississippi, and here we had retreated.</p>

<p>But when we began to look at the chief difficulties
of the campaign,&mdash;that of keeping open two to three
hundred miles of railroad communication in the face
of a bold and enterprising enemy, it was not so much
a surprise to us that it had proved a failure, as that it
had been undertaken at all. Our only source of hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
now was, that Grant would undertake the capture
of Vicksburg by the more practicable route of the
Mississippi.</p>

<p>The road was well beaten by previous columns of
troops, and a vigorous march brought us to Wolf River,
where we passed the night. In the morning we crossed
the river and went into camp around Moscow, relieving
a part of Logan's division.</p>

<p>The troops, lately constituting the 13th Army Corps,
were re-organized into four corps, the 13th, 15th, 16th
and 17th, commanded respectively by Major Generals
McClernand, Sherman, Hurlbut and McPherson. The
Fourth Division, at first attached to the 17th, was soon
transferred to the 16th Corps, and thus it was again
under its old commander. It was distributed in detachments
of different sizes along the Memphis and Charleston
Railroad, from Moscow on the east, to Colliersville
on the west. General Lauman had his headquarters at
the former place. For a short period, during his temporary
absence, Colonel Pugh was in command of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
division, and Colonel Moore, of the 33d Wisconsin, in
command of the 1st Brigade.</p>

<p>The eight weeks our regiment passed at Moscow,
transpired without any occurrence of importance. The
line of railroad guarded in part by our division ran
parallel to the enemy's late front of operations; but the
winter rains soon put the roads in an execrable condition,
and besides, he was too much attracted in the
direction of Vicksburg by Grant, who, with McPherson's
corps, had gone thither to join McClernand and
Sherman, and renew in person operations for the reduction
of that stronghold, to make any demonstrations
against us. But we were not without the usual number
of rumors and reports of the enemy's approach, and
of actual alarms by night and day. I have described
similar occurrences so often, that it would be superfluous
to mention them here.</p>

<p>One little occurrence, however, as it was the first
of the kind that has ever happened to our regiment,
must not be passed over. We still supplied our animals
with forage from the country, and for this purpose were
accustomed to send out expeditions in all directions,
frequently ten or twelve miles, and with great boldness.
On one occasion, a brigade train was out with an escort
commanded by Major Long, of the 41st Illinois. They
were returning with loaded wagons, a part of the guard
with the Major marching in lead of the train, while the
remainder, under Lieut. Hall, of the 3d Iowa, brought
up the rear. Some of the wagons got stuck in the mud,
and the rear guard, halting to help them out, was left
about half a mile behind the main portion of the train,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
when, about two miles from the picket lines, a band
of Richardson's guerrillas dashed down a narrow lane
into the main road, and with fiendish yells attacked the
center of the train, and before the rear guard could get
up, succeeded in getting away about fifty mules and a
dozen teamsters. They shot and mortally wounded
one teamster, who refused to unhitch his mules. The
rear guard fired several volleys at them with but little
effect. The guerrillas traveled through fields, woods,
and over by-roads to their place of rendezvous somewhere
to the north. Here they paroled the boys, who
found their way to Fort Pillow, and thence back again
to Moscow.</p>

<p>On the 11th of March, we were relieved at Moscow
by a part of Denver's division, and took up the march
toward Memphis. We bivouacked the first night at
Colliersville. Before we could get up our tents, it began
to rain heavily and continued with little intermission
till morning. We had to lay exposed to it all the while,
with whatever patience we could summon for the occasion.
When the morning broke, an abundance of dry
rails afforded fires, from which we derived a little comfort,
until, at 9 o'clock, the march was resumed.</p>

<p>Soon after starting, it again began to rain, and continued,
till nearly night, cold and heavy from the
northwest. With great fatigue and immense straggling
we reached White's Station, where, in the deep, soft
mud, we passed a night, cold, dreary and comfortless
enough.</p>

<p>The next day was cool and pleasant. Starting
late, we reached Memphis in the afternoon, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
went into camp on the western environs of the
city.</p>

<p>Two more months of monotonous camp-life. Major
Brown had been promoted Colonel, at Moscow; and
now, at the almost unanimous request of the officers
of the regiment, Captain James Tullis, of Company H,
a very brave soldier and proper man, who had been
twice wounded in battle, was appointed Lieut. Colonel,
and 1st Lieut. George W. Crosley, whose gallant conduct
at Blue Mills and Shiloh, I have already mentioned,
was appointed Major. These appointments gave very
general satisfaction. The line officers of our regiment
were now for the most part men who had served in the
ranks, and who were faithful to their duties, and loved
and respected by their men; and what was more, they
had been tried in the ordeal of battle, and had not been
found wanting. Compared with many regiments in the
field, our's was exceedingly fortunate in this respect.</p>

<p>General Lauman instituted a regulation that two
regiments of the division should meet each evening on
the green, in front of his headquarters, for drill. This
excited a spirit of rivalry among some of the regiments,
which, between the 41st Illinois, of Colonel Pugh's
brigade, and the 14th Illinois, of Colonel Hall's brigade,
increased to great bitterness. These regiments drilled
twice against each other, the second time in pursuance
of a challenge from Lieut. Col. Carn of the 14th. The
prize of this drill was a silver bugle, purchased jointly
by the officers of both regiments. The judges could
not be accused of partiality in their decision. As in
the first trial the 41st had borne away the palm, so in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
this it bore away the bugle. Both regiments went
through the various movements in a manner which
excited the highest admiration; and yet few of the
spectators, who were strangers to both, would have
awarded the prize differently. I confess that in this
strife, and in the jealousy and bickerings which grew
out of it, the sympathies of the men of our regiment
were with the 41st. We had always belonged to the
same brigade, had fought on the same field in the battle
of Shiloh, had been side by side in prosperous and
adverse circumstances, and now that we were camped
close by each other, a singular attachment, which was
universal throughout both regiments, had sprung up
between us. General Lauman understood this, and our
regiment never drilled against the 41st.</p>

<p>These drills with our regiment were productive of the
most beneficial results. Captain Smith was, for a while
our drill master, and a model one he was too. When
Major Crosley received his appointment and returned
from the brigade staff, he was assigned to this duty.
For the first day or two he put us through the exercises
with some difficulty; but he was too ambitious to allow
us to suffer at his hands, and he soon became proficient
in the tactics, and an excellent drill master.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most memorable event of this period was
the review of the Fourth Division, by its old chief,
General Hurlbut. The scene took place on the fair
grounds northeast of the city. It was an occasion
calculated to call up old memories. Hurlbut, Lauman
and Veatch, three generals, under whom we had served
through Shiloh, Corinth and Matamora, were there, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
there also, under the tattered banners they had borne
through those storms, were the troops they had commanded
so bravely and so well; generals and men between
whom existed the strongest ties that can bind
men together, recollections of mutual peril and the
possession of a common glory. Here we again met
the generals who had been so proud to command us,
and whom we had been so happy and proud to follow.
It seemed like a renewal of the past.</p>

<p>A large concourse of citizens and soldiers were
present to witness it. <cite>The Memphis Bulletin</cite> thus
described it:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yesterday, at about ten o'clock in the morning, the
division was drawn up by Brigadier General Lauman,
preparatory to the review by General Hurlbut. We
have seen these splendid reviews so graphically described
by the "Knights of the quill," of the army of
the Potomac, by General McClellan&mdash;when that army
was in its prime,&mdash;but never did we look upon a body
of men presenting a more soldierly appearance than
did the Fourth Division yesterday. The old veterans
who had passed through the fires of Pittsburg Landing,
Corinth, Matamora, and other fields of action, who had
scattered the armies under Van Dorn and Price,
reminded us of the soldiers who fought in the
Crimea.</p>

<p>As General Hurlbut rode along the line accompanied
by his staff, we thought for the moment that our eyes
never rested on a more captivating picture. It was a
glorious sight. The review was what all anticipated
it would be. Not a single man&oelig;uver was at fault.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
From "shoulder arms," to the end of the review, all
went smoothly, without a mistake. It is necessary to
have educated officers to make good soldiers; and if any
thing was wanting to convince the hundreds of ladies
and gentlemen present at the review, of the falsity of
the report, that the officers of the Fourth Division were
not thoroughly qualified for the position they occupy, it
is now entirely dispelled."</p>

<p>On the 17th of April, an expedition was sent into
Mississippi against Chalmers, who held the rebel lines
southeast of Memphis. It was commanded by Colonel
Bryant, of the 12th Wisconsin, now in command of the
3d Brigade. While it was gone, the wildest rumors
gained circulation in the city, and a thousand and one
reports of fighting on the Cold Water, flew through our
camps. But after a week it returned without having
met any occurrence of importance.</p>

<p>Early in May, intimations came that we were ordered
to Nicksburg, and these were followed by orders to be
ready to move on the shortest notice. The 3d Brigade
moved first; in a few days it was followed by the 2d,
and on the 17th the 1st struck tents and prepared to
embark.</p>

<p>And here end my personal recollections with the 3d
Iowa. I was at this time detached from my regiment
to remain at Memphis. It was with no ordinary feelings,
on the morning of the 18th, on board of the Crescent
City, I parted with my comrades. I had not supposed
that I had become so attached to those men.
And it was with strange feelings of regret that I stood
on the bluffs of Fort Pickering, and gazed upon their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
boat as it sped down the noble waters, like a bird that
is flying away. And when it had disappeared, and I
could see it no more, an indescribable vacancy seemed
to surround me. Nothing looked familiar to me; I felt
as though I were in a strange land. Separated from
the men with whom for two years I had been associated
in extraordinary circumstances; I left behind, and they
gone to meet unknown hazards and to preserve their
past career of glory. I expected never to join them
again, and knew that I had shook hands with many of
them for the last time. I must now turn to the strangers
surrounding me, and among them form new associations
and find new comrades.</p>

<p>If I have succeeded in making this book of interest
to any reader, he will surely be unwilling to pardon me,
if I do not go with my regiment briefly through the
scenes which followed&mdash;its participation in what was the
crowning glory to the army of the Tennessee, the siege
and capture of Vicksburg, and where at Jackson my
comrades fought for honor and without hope.</p>

<p>The transports conveying the 1st Brigade were convoyed
by a gunboat of the musquito fleet. In the afternoon
of the following day the gunboat had dropped
behind and the Crescent City was in lead; while passing
unconcernedly along near the foot of Island 65, a force
of guerrillas opened upon it with two howitzers from a
covert of young timber, throwing canister and shells.
The first shots took effect, wounding thirteen men of
the 3d Iowa, one of them mortally. To protect her
machinery, the boat immediately refused her broadside
and presented her stern. From this end of the boat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
the boys began to reply with musketry, when the
gunboat coming up, the guerrillas fled. The gunboat
opened fire upon them, and the troops landed. The
41st and 53d Illinois pursued them two or three miles
without overtaking them. When they returned, the
brigade moved down the shore three miles to the town
of Greenwood, which they set fire to and burned&mdash;house
and hovel, sparing not even the church.</p>

<p>At noon the next day they arrived at Young's Point,
disembarked, and, after cooking their dinners on the
shore, started to march across the peninsula. After
proceeding half a mile, they were halted, and waited
for orders till ten o'clock at night. During the afternoon
the scene around was inexpressibly sublime. They
could see the shells of Porter's fleet from below bursting
over the city, and the enemy's river batteries replying.
While on the bluff above it, they could discern, under a
dense cloud of smoke, Steele's infantry and artillery
hotly engaged, as well as the smoke which rose from
the enemy's forts on his front. The gunboat, Choctaw,
also dropped down, for some reason, to draw the
enemy's fire. His guns opened upon her heavily, and,
when she had reached a position about half a mile
below the red flags which marked the enemy's furthest
range, she halted and lay in the channel but did not
reply. Her guns were not of sufficient range to reach
his batteries. As soon as the enemy saw her object,
he ceased firing. Some of his shots in their flight had
crossed the river, the peninsula and the river again,
and lodged above the city on the Mississippi shore.
During the night the scene was still more sublime.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
Signal rockets from the gunboats flashing against the
sky, and the shells from the mortar fleet describing in
their flight an immense curve of fire, making the noise
of a distant wind storm, and bursting in fitful flashes
over the doomed city. They could likewise see the
flashes of Steele's artillery, and at times the flames
leaping from the mouths of the enemy's responding
cannon.</p>

<p>The brigade went aboard the boats in the night, and
had all the baggage they were to take with them got
aboard before midnight. The rest, comprising most
of their tents and camp equipage, was left under a
guard detailed for the purpose. That of the 3d Iowa
was commanded by Lieut. Lakin.</p>

<p>At daylight their fleet moved into the mouth of the
Yazoo where they found the Choctaw, which joined the
musquito boat that had convoyed them from Memphis,
and the two convoyed them to Haines' Bluff. The
position was found to be evacuated, and Companies G
and K of the 3d Iowa landed and occupied it. Here
they found a rebel hospital, containing about 360 patients,
who were paroled the following day. The brigade
landed about a mile below to execute the purpose of the
expedition, that of opening communication with Sherman.
Meanwhile the crew of the Choctaw landed and
commenced blowing up the enemy's numerous magazines
and bursting the guns he had abandoned. Some
of these magazines were filled with loaded shells, which
were thrown into the air and exploded in all directions.
In this way were destroyed an immense quantity of
ordnance and ordnance stores, which might have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
made serviceable to General Grant in the subsequent
operations of the siege. But it was expected that Johnson
would move in this way to attack Grant in the rear,
and it was deemed more prudent to destroy them than
to run the risk of their falling into his hands.</p>

<p>Our boys found here plenty of tents and camp equipage
abandoned by the enemy, and supplied themselves
even better than they were before. Gen. Lauman immediately
went back to Young's Point on a dispatch
boat for orders, and soon after the brigade marched from
where it lay to a position on the bluff, where the two
companies were, and here spent the night.</p>

<p>The next day was the memorable 22d of May, on
which Grant made his second assault on the enemy's
works. They could hear the sounds of the battle&mdash;on
the right the infantry engaging with a continuous war,
and with it the quick jar of the batteries, and above all
the thunders of Porter's fleet. Of the cause of all this
they knew nothing; but conjectured the army was
forcing its way into the beleaguered city. That day
the Choctaw and musquito boats went up the Yazoo as
far as Greenwood, but could not pass the batteries there.
The same evening the brigade was relieved by a cavalry
division under command of Major General Washburne.</p>

<p>Next morning it moved toward Vicksburg to take
position in the investing lines. As they advanced they
met many supply wagons on the way to the Yazoo, the
teamsters giving dolorous accounts of yesterday's repulse,
and saying frequently, in the most discouraging
tones, "Boys, we can't take 'em; they're too well fortified."
As they approached the lines of the army they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
saw scattered through the woods many men who had
been wounded in the previous day's fight; and many
more in cotton sheds, crowded together on the soft
cotton, as thick as they could be placed&mdash;men who had
marched hither from Bruinsburg, without a change of
clothing or a cooking utensil, dirty, ragged, and clotted
with blood, lay under dense clouds of settling dust,
raised by the troops and trains continually crowding
past. It was a spectacle of wretchedness sufficient to
appal common men. That night the 1st Brigade camped
south of the Jackson Railroad, and about a mile and a
half from Fort Hill, the rebel work which guarded the
main entrance into the city. They were not allowed
fires, and had to eat their raw bacon and hard crackers
with the best relish they could.</p>

<p>On the 30th, they had out a strong force to protect
their pioneer corps in constructing roads on which to
bring up gabions to protect the rifle pits, to be constructed,
from the enemy's flanking fire. That night
their pickets advanced and drove those of the enemy
from the hill they occupied. Here they dug their first
line of rifle pits, a straight ditch, and in it inserted the
gabions at intervals, with sufficient room for a single
man to pass round them without getting out of the
ditch. At daylight the enemy's artillery opened from
What was known as the sand bag fort on the right, and
speedily cleared the ditch of these obstructions, killing
two men of the 41st Illinois. Of course this experiment
was not again repeated.</p>

<p>That day our pickets protected themselves as well as
they could. As soon as it was dark, Capt. Knight, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
the 3d Iowa, crawling between the two picket lines,
ours and the enemy's, made a survey of the ground
which enabled them next morning to commence digging
zigzag rifle pits, by which they were enabled to advance
their line steadily, under protection from the enemy's
fire, front and flank. They did not extend these rifle
pits through the valleys, but, on gaining the slope of a
hill towards the enemy, would drive him from his rifle
pits on the opposite hill by a night assault, and, occupying
them, change the embankment to the other side,
and commence anew their operations. They deviated
from this rule in but one instance. Thus, until the final
surrender, with frequent artillery duels and sharp engagements
of the infantry; laboring and watching night
and day; exposed constantly to an alternation of burning
sun and chilling dew; amid a succession of scenes
the most unreal; where romance itself palled on the
sense and became monotonous; amid hardships which,
under ordinary circumstances, few would have endured,
they forced their steady progress toward the enemy.</p>

COLONEL PUGH'S BRIGADE&mdash;The blame imputed to General

<p>The first indication of the enemy's desire to capitulate,
was a flag of truce which was seen to approach our
lines from a point near Fort Hill. The firing immediately
ceased at that point, and gradually died away
to the right and left. The enemy's troops became more
bold, and began to appear along their rifle pits. Ours
likewise began to show themselves, and before noon the
works of either side were lined with their respective
uniforms, blue and grey. In some cases the antagonists
mingled, and many of the enemy came into our camps,
but General Grant ordered them to be sent back. So
thick was the smoke, that it was not before 11 o'clock
that the fleet saw the signal to cease firing. About
one o'clock the flag of truce went back, and the firing
again began at that point, and was soon resumed along
the line, and within an hour the fleet again opened.
About three o'clock another flag of truce came out; the
firing again ceased, and the troops of either side appeared
on their works much more readily than before.
Orders soon after came for the firing to be permanently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
discontinued. Our troops lay in their rifle pits all night,
in the highest spirits. Daylight found the rebels in
plain view all along their works, and our boys likewise
coming out of their holes to see what they could see.
It was the Fourth of July. At eight o'clock a national
salute was fired with blank cartridges from the batteries
along our entire line. About ten o'clock, from the
position of our regiment, with a field glass, the enemy
might be seen to take down his flag from Fort Hill, and
hoist a white flag in its stead. Then two men started,
each with a bundle of white flags, and proceeded either
way, hoisting them along the works. As each flag was
raised, the men in front of it would cheer frantically,
and all along our lines the boys from the tops of their
works began to sing national airs, while the rebels from
theirs listened in gloomy silence. Soon the late combatants
mingled together, the rebels streaming through
all our camps. Their salutations were characteristic
of their situation. "Boys," they would say, shaking
hands, "this is strange; yesterday we were trying to
kill each other, now we are meeting as friends." For
the most part the rebels seemed quite disheartened; and
many of them, speaking of the war, used an expression
which seemed to have become proverbial among them:
"This is the rich man's quarrel, but the poor man's
fight." Thus they mingled together, victor and vanquished,&mdash;smoked,
played cards, and, over pots of hot
coffee, discussed the war and related their adventures,
like old comrades who, after a long absence, had just met.</p>

<p>But the troops of our division were not allowed the
privilege of mingling long with their late foes. Our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
division was among the troops assigned to Sherman by
orders from General Grant, with which, in the event
of the success of the proposed assault on the sixth of
July, he was to take the field immediately against
Johnson. He was found in force around Jackson,
strongly entrenched. It was not attempted to carry
his works by assault; this was deemed impracticable,
and the operations of a siege commenced.</p>

<p>The line of siege was formed on the eleventh, Hovey
and Lauman, of Ord's corps, being on the extreme right.
On the morning of the 12th, the 33d Wisconsin was
sent across the Mississippi Central Railroad to Pearl
River, and the 28th Illinois took their places in the
1st Brigade. Thus it seems as if fate had decreed that
this gallant regiment, which had suffered side by side
with ours in the disastrous bend of the Hatchie, should
under the same generals suffer useless butchery now.
In its first battle, the Third Iowa had fought for honor,
but with some hope of victory; and now, in what was
probably to be its last one, it was to fight for honor, but
without hope;&mdash;nay, even to advance upon death itself,
without the least encouragement of success.</p>

<p>Having disposed his divisions, General Ord ordered
the generals commanding them to advance their lines.
The left of our 1st Brigade was at that time considerably
behind the right of Hovey. The troops moved forward
as steadily as upon review, without hesitating or
swerving, or showing any signs of precipitancy. It
was a sight calculated to captivate the eye of a spectator,
and fill with pride the heart of any general.
What wonder? Were they not veterans, imbrowned by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
long exposure, and at home amid the elements of
battle?</p>

<p>Colonel Pugh's skirmishers soon became hotly engaged.
He reported the fact to General Lauman, who
ordered him to continue to advance. He pushed back
the enemy's skirmishers, till he came within sight of his
main works, formidable in appearance, his guns pointing
through embrasures, and his field of fire level and unobstructed
(even the corn-stalks being cut down), affording
no possible cover to an advancing line. The colonel
now reported in person his position to General Lauman;
but the general still ordered him to advance. He returned,
and swept with his eye the field. There was
the enemy's long line of works, showing the mouths of
his defiant cannon, and near him the remnant of his
gallant brigade, now only eight hundred strong, which
he was ordered to destroy. It must have been a harrowing
moment to him. What was he to do? His order
was imperative, and he was too true a soldier to question,
much less to disobey it. To advance partially
and then retreat, would seem to exhibit cowardice, and
would be worse than to refuse to advance at all. To
advance within musket range, and halt and engage the
enemy, would be to court destruction without preserving
honor, and without the possibility of injuring him. Besides,
he was not instructed to halt at all. He gave the
order to his men, and the line moved steadily forward,
without support or diversion on the right or left, or a
single shell having been thrown to test the enemy's
strength, or prepare their way. From regimental commanders
to the rank and file&mdash;all were astonished. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
first they supposed it was to be a general charge of the
line, but their eyes soon undeceived them. A terrible
realization of their situation came over them; but no
one faltered or looked back. They had won too much
glory on former fields to sully that record now. They
must preserve honor, though they lost all else.</p>

<p>The enemy opened with fourteen pieces, and two
brigades of infantry rose from their concealment, and
poured a converging fire upon them. Colonel Pugh
gave the command to charge; the men raised the shout
and sprang forward through that thick storm of death.
A few moments, and all was over. The line crumbled
into broken bands, which arrived within pistol-shot of
the embrasures, and halted and staggered and were
swept away. Those who escaped had scarcely time to
notice who had fallen. Back in the woods, where the
advance had first commenced, they rallied&mdash;all that was
left, but less than half the number that had advanced
into that terrific fire. The Third Iowa had saved both
its flag and banner; and now, of the two hundred and
ten that advanced in the charge, but ninety could be
rallied around them. Nearly all who were not there
were killed, wounded or captured. General Lauman
wept when he gazed on this remnant of his old brigade.
Gen. Ord immediately relieved him of his command, and
ordered him to report to Gen. Grant, at Vicksburg.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span></p>
<p>Under the excitement of the moment, most voices
were loud in imputing this disaster to him. No one
could believe that he intended that this handful of men
should charge unsupported a portion of the enemy's
works. But all attributed it to his misunderstanding
the orders of General Ord. Thus in common opinion
the fault rested with these two generals. Either the
one had communicated his orders unintelligibly, or the
other had culpably misunderstood them. As generals
are not apt to solicit the arbitrament of public opinion
upon their conduct, and commonly keep their own
secrets, we are only able to form conjectures in this
matter. Calm reflection, however, can not but allow
that it was unfair to lay the whole blame to a general,
who, on all previous fields, had behaved with the gallantry
and merit that had distinguished General Lauman. It is
notable, that after there had been time for reflection,
those of the division loudest in condemning him did not
belong to the 1st Brigade. Nor is there a more striking
instance of the ingratitude of common opinion, than in
the case of those, who, in censuring him for this affair,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
forgot the general of Belmont, Fort Donelson, Shiloh
and the Hatchie.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>The casualties of this affair were deplorable. Each
regiment was literally torn in pieces. In proportion to
their numbers the 53d Illinois suffered most, to say
nothing of losing their gallant Colonel Earle, who was
struck by a volley of canister while riding in advance
of his men. Our own regiment lost one hundred and
thirteen, sixteen being killed, fifty-seven wounded, and
forty missing and taken prisoners. A number of the
wounds were mortal. Among those who lost their lives
were some of our best names. The Ruckman brothers,
the one Captain, the other 2d Lieutenant of Company B;
1st Lieutenant Hall, of the same company; and 1st
Lieutenant McMurtry of Company D; 1st Sergeants
Woodruff of Company B, and McClure of Company I;
Sergeants Gilmore and Dent of Company E, Follett of
Company F, and many other gallant names were among
the sacrifices of this needless blunder. It would gratify
me to mention the whole list of casualties in full&mdash;it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>would be a <i>roll of honor</i> indeed&mdash;but as I could not
obtain those of our other battles, I have refrained
from giving this. Besides, their names deserve better
memorial than mere mention in such a book as this.
Among the severely wounded were Colonel Brown,
Captain Geary, and Lieutenant Abernethy,&mdash;officers
whose conduct here and on former fields, needs no eulogy
from such a pen as mine. But I will not further dwell
upon this affair&mdash;the saddest chapter of all my
"recollections."</p>

<p>After the capture of Jackson, our regiment returned
with Sherman's army to Vicksburg, and with the division
was soon after ordered to Natchez, where it was
stationed till winter, when it again returned to Vicksburg,
and was stationed for a while in rear of that place,
at Hebron. It has just returned to Vicksburg from
Sherman's remarkable expedition to the Alabama line.</p>

<p>Comrades of the 3d Iowa! Thus far I have endeavored
to follow you in this narrative through your
campaigns and battles, to describe, as I saw them, some
of the scenes you saw, and, as I felt and understood
them, some of the hardships you suffered. I am as
sensible as you can be, of how partially I have succeeded.
To me, who came among you curious to see some of the
pictures of war, your sufferings have seemed unreal,
your exploits like romance. None but those who have
been soldiers can ever understand these things. I am
aware that I am addressing the 3d Iowa only in name&mdash;that
I am addressing but a remnant of the gallant band
that assembled under our regimental flag at Keokuk,
nearly three years ago. Of the others, many have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
promoted, and are now serving honorably in other corps;
one who commanded us in our most memorable battle,
is Governor of our State; many have been taken from
the service by wounds and disease, and many have fallen
and perished&mdash;where? We may ask the cemeteries of
almost every hospital in the West; the fields of Blue
Mills, Shiloh, Matamora, Vicksburg and Jackson; the
prairies of Missouri, and the woods of Tennessee and
Mississippi, whose hostile soil has received them to its
bosom; and the soil of their once happy homes to which
the ashes of some of them have been removed. But
they are not dead&mdash;we can not call them dead; for they
live, and will live in affectionate remembrance as long
as lives a member of the 3d Iowa. And of those who
suffer from wounds received or diseases contracted while
serving with us, let no one say that he has found one
who, for relief from those sufferings, would be willing to
give up the grand memories of the past, and the consciousness
of honor merited&mdash;though it be not recorded&mdash;by
hazard, hardship and gallant service in a glorious
cause.</p>

<p>In taking leave of you, I would I could pay a sufficient
tribute to those of you who have heretofore served
and still serve in the grades of enlisted men. The people
do not seem to understand this matter. They are
not convinced that military rank alone is not an evidence
of merit. They seem to have forgotten how many
army officers of different grades, at the outbreak of the
rebellion, betrayed their commands, and rushed to the
standard of the traitors, while the private soldiers&mdash;whose
services, considered menial, had neither been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
honored nor paid&mdash;through obloquy, persecution and
imprisonment, remained true to their country and their
trust. They will not believe that preferment comes less
by actual merit than by favoritism, intrigue or accident.
They are slow to understand, that the hardships you
suffer the commissioned officer does not always suffer
in common with you. But be assured they will one
day understand these things; and when they come to
make a final award of honors to their gallant defenders,
it will not be asked of any, "Was he a captain or a
colonel?" but rather, "Did he do his whole duty in the
place assigned him?" They will count your motives,
in engaging in the war, unimpeachable. You have not
served for money; you have not expected your toils and
sufferings to be thus requited. You have not served for
spoils; for you knew that the war would be conducted
on civilized principles, and that there would be no spoils
to divide. You have not served for the "bauble reputation;"
for you well know how poor a chance you have
had of gaining that. With whatever merit you may
have served the operations of the war, your names have
seldom been mentioned in official reports; officers alone,
with few exceptions, enjoying the privilege of being able
to have their names thus recorded among the military
archives of the country. No: your motives have been
higher and worthier than these. You have suffered
most and have sought and received the fewest rewards.
What you have not achieved in the gaining of money or
personal reputation, you will one day receive in honor.
History will dwell with delight upon the skill and resolution
of the generals who have led you to victory; it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
will dwell with delight both upon them and you. But
if it admire their conduct as splendid, it will reverence
yours as sublime. Nor think your services will be
thankless. Time, which metes out justice to all, will
see your sacrifices acknowledged and your merits recognized.
The hearts of the great people that compose the
Republic will go out in praise and gratitude to you.
Public honors will come to reward your now humble
services. Posterity will record you, as being among
those who offered all they had, that the nation and
liberty might live, an "all unclouded glory;" and on
your names will attend, "The tears and praises of all
time."</p>

<p>Comrades!&mdash;Your friends are gratified to learn, that
what remains of the 3d Iowa has re-enlisted as a veteran
regiment. Fields of honor are yet before you, and it is
for you to participate in the last glorious deeds of the
war. This thought should afford you no ordinary gratification;
for to have fought both on its first and last
fields will be counted no common honor. Your past
record is one of glory; there are no fears that you will
not continue to deserve it. Committing this book to
you, and assuring you that though absent and serving
in another corps, I am still with you in the memories
and feelings of the past, I bid you an affectionate
farewell.<br /><br /></p>

 I have been unable to obtain the official report of this battle
by our regimental commander, and through fear of making invidious
comparisons, have refrained from mentioning the names of
certain officers and men whose bravery was especially conspicuous.
Among these, Trumbull, Knight, Crossley and Lakin sustained in
a splendid manner on the first day's field, the reputation they had
won at Blue Mills. Lieutenant Crossley was called to command
the regiment late in the afternoon of Sunday, and from that time
till Monday, did his duty with a degree of heroism which merits
the life-long, honored gratitude of every member of our regiment.
He rose with every occasion; and amid the severest shocks, and
heaviest disasters, no one seemed so capable of inspiring men as
he. Trumbull acted as field officer, and was conspicuous for his
cool gallantry till in the afternoon of Sunday, when he was
wounded by a shell and compelled to quit the field. Sergeant
Lakin bore the colors the first day with a bravery nowhere surpassed;
but during the night he was taken severely ill, and was
unable to carry them the second day. In his absence Corporal
Anderson Edwards filled his place in a manner which can not be
too highly praised.</p></div>

 This gallant and high-minded officer joined us with some military
experience, having served in the Mexican war. He was with
us in all our battles, and on all occasions behaved with a degree
of courage and resolution seldom equalled, nowhere surpassed.
In camp and on the march his conduct was no less meritorious.
He kept himself thoroughly acquainted with his duties, and on all
occasions commanded the highest personal and official respect.
His generosity knew no distinction of rank; for a gallant officer
or soldier he could not do too much, and there was but one offense
which he could not forgive: misbehavior in the face of the enemy.
To those guilty of this he was particularly intolerant. In short,
he possessed in a high degree the elements which make up a successful
soldier, and his comrades, and those who served under him,
have learned with gratification that he is again in the service, as
colonel of the 9th Iowa Cavalry, with the gallant Knight, first
lieutenant and then captain of his old company in the 3d Iowa, as
lieutenant-colonel.</p></div>

mar it, but that you give to your present or future commander
that prompt obedience to orders which has always characterized
the division, and which has given to it the proud position which
it now enjoys.
</p>
<p>
Officers and soldiers, I bid you now an affectionate farewell.

 General Lauman entered the service as Colonel of the 7th Iowa
Infantry. He commanded his regiment in the battle of Belmont,
where it suffered most, and distinguished itself above all others.
Its conduct won special mention in General Grant's official report.
In this action Colonel Lauman was severely wounded. At Fort
Donelson he commanded the brigade of Smith's division, consisting
of the 2d, 7th, 12th Iowa, and the 25th Indiana regiments,
which performed the most gallant and successful achievement
of that engagement, the carrying by storm of the enemy's works
on our left&mdash;which compelled his surrender the following morning.
At Shiloh he commanded the 3d Brigade of the 4th Division.
Since then he has been with us most of the time in this narrative.
His personal courage was of the first order; and his humanity
and kindness towards his men were conspicuous upon all occasions.
Those who complain of such a general do not deserve to
be under so good a one.</p></div>
